       "[u'Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.',\n",
       " u\"I am a big believer in first impressions, so when I go to a new business I pay close attention to how they treat me and how they run their business. Joe was very polite and friendly as soon as I met him, as was his shop assistant. I needed a CV joint installed as well as a new transmission mount. Joe was nice enough to estimate a fair price to install both, he honored that price, was fast, very friendly, and treated me like he knew me for years. It's a great neighborhood shop and Joe is a real nice guy who could have easily raked me over the coals, but he didn't. I know quite a bit about cars, and everything he told me was true. He's earned my repeat business immediately. Give him a call, you'll be glad you did. Thanks Joe!\",\n",
       " u'My fianc\\xe9 upgraded his phone at the Apple store, but got a strange text on his new phone about his plan. We went over to the Verizon store to see what was up, and that was about as pleasant as having forks jammed in my eyes. Awful customer service. No one came up to ask us if we needed help. We had to tear a disgruntled man away from looking at his instagram feed to help us. He didn\\'t say there would be a wait or to sit or anything, just said \"okay then\" and left us. So we stood there waiting for help or even just directions for far too long, were ignored and told him we were leaving. Awful awful awful customer service.',\n",
       " u\"Waited over 45 mins, 2 people ahead of me and I'm finally getting helped...  Wtf???\\nI can understand them being busy but that was ridiculous.  I work out in Robinson and went to the Settlers Ridge location and BOY- WHAT A DIFFERENCE.  They were awesome.  In & out the door in 20 minutes- I ended up with a new 6s and my wife ordered a 6sPlus... All in less than 20 minutes!  I'll never go to this store anymore.\",\n",
       " u\"From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.\",\n",
       " u\"Another divey place we have been going to for years. My dad's favorite, as he knows the original owners. Certain items on the menu are named after the kids. Huge portions, might have a bit of a wait some nights. Huge burgers, fish sandwiches, salads. Decent service.\",\n",
       " u\"Love my hometown favorites. Cannot beat their fish sandwiches (although I do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced bread...stop that). Always will support Emil's\\nOther favorites include Reuben, Hawkins Avenue sandwich, Chrissy Club.\",\n",
       " u\"I love everything about this place. The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.\\n\\nAlso, the food is really good. :)\",\n",
       " u\"I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  \\n\\nThe place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.\\n\\nThe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  \\n\\nThe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\\n\\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\\n\\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go.\",\n",
       " u'We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!',\n",
       " u\"We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don't forget the liver and onions.\",\n",
       " u\"Excellent fish sandwich, Wonderful Reuben Sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   Chrissy \\nIs a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  Restaurant personnel are pleasant.   I really enjoy visiting Emils when I'm in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays.   Worth the trip\",\n",
       " u\"Have been coming to this gym for many years now mainly because of the proximity to my house and low-ish price. \\n\\nPros:\\n-engaging, diverse range of classes that get switched up often. I have seen tai chi, cross fit, kettle bell, etc. they make an effort to keep up with fitness trends and the teachers are often inspiring and sociable. Going to spin and aerobics classes at EF can feel like being part of a community if you want it to\\n\\n-functional equipment, various types of elliptical machines. Some things are old but some are new  \\n\\nCons:\\n-inconsistent with providing free sweat towels. Sometimes they are there sometimes they aren't. Not the hugest deal in the world\\n\\n-NO SOAP IN THE WOMENS BATHROOM EVER. Seriously disgusting at a gym to know that no one is washing their hands with soap. \\n\\n-no pool, yet still costs as much as LA fitness which has more facilities. However I understand it is a family owned business so I support them regardless\",\n",
       " u\"Don't go here! This place is a scam. When it comes to opening, freezing, and canceling your membership it is not easy or convenient and they get every last penny from you for a mediocre gym with sweaty smelly locker rooms. Go to LA Fitness. Bad experience here.\",\n",
       " u\"The bar is nice enough the servers are attentive enough the food is good enough. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd. It's kind of lost in the crowd. Pittsburgh is a city full of bars this one is relaxed. It's a great neighborhood bar. And I would come back but it is not a wow that is a great place.  It's just good enough\",\n",

       " u\"Friendly staff, good food, great beer selection, and relaxing atmosphere. Great wings and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best I've had. The sandwiches are all on thick cut Italian bread and fresh. Definitely  a hidden gem of the Greetree/Carnegie area. Looking for a low key hole in the wall with good prices and great food this is your place.\",\n",
       " u'Found this place on Yelp and glad we did. Great beer selection, the sandwiches are wonderful and huge, wings were very good. Family owned establishment and everyone we met was great, the owner, waitstaff and kitchen staff.  If we ever get to The Pittsburgh area again, we will go back!',\n",
       " u\"Perfect joint! Don't be afraid as you pull up... It's a nice little neighborhood. Was in town on biz and my hotel was right up the street. Great service, well apportioned servings and unique menu make this place worthy of a check in!\",\n",
       " u'Awesome experience!   I came in all fatalistic with my flat tire on a workday morning with a full schedule. \\n\\nThey saw me and worked on my car like a NASCAR pit crew.\\n\\nI was prepared to buy new tires.  They offered to look to see if they could repair.\\n\\nThey repaired them.  I saved alot of money.  #integrity #greatcustomerservice',\n",
       " u\"I took my wife's car in for new tires on good Friday. I felt that the prices were reasonable, I didn't feel pressured to buy the most expensive tire, and I was out in less than 2 hours with no appointment.\",\n",
       " u\"I cannot praise this place enough. I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:\\n* They do not over charge\\n* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way\\n* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays\\n* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. \\n* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal. \\n\\nThankyou Greentree Animal Clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all Veterinary Care Facilities.\",\n",
       " u'I can;t believe this place has a high rating. I had a bichon, who was seen here since his puppyhood and who was dying. I called to make an appointment to have him put down because he was in great pain. The receptionist would not give me an appointment until one week later, even though she could hear him crying out in pain. Anyway, he died in agony before his appointment. This was in 2010 and I have not taken my subsequent pets to the clinic.',\n",
       " u'Awesome historic building high on top of the hill in Carnegie. Home to stage 62, a theatre group that puts on musicals. I recently saw Sideshow and Evita here. Great sound and comfortable chairs, an all around pleasant experience for a pleasant evening or Sunday matinee. Plenty of free parking and at only 18 dollars its a true bargain. \\n\\nAnd yes, the rumors are true, this building is haunted.',\n",
       " u'Beautiful restoration of the library and music hall.   Look forward to coming here for shows.',\n",
       " u\"I actually stopped at the one at the Crafton Ingram shopping center but they are all basically the same. \\n\\nI had been here earlier this year to get replacement wiper blades. The man who helped me not only gave me his recommendation on what would be good for winter driving but also put them on my car.\\n\\nToday's visit was to purchase some general car supplies as a holiday gift. They carry basically everything you need for self service. I'm not overly sure on their pricing but since it is convenient for me I visit it.\\n\\nSo far I've been pleased with my purchases.\",\n",
       " u'Breakfast Time!\\n\\nI stopped by the Kings Family Restaurant prior to grocery shopping.    I have never been to a Kings Family Restaurant since moving to Pittsburgh.   There are several local establishments.\\n\\nThis particular location has pretty good food at a great price.   It is similar to a Cracker Barrel and / or Bob Evans.   I ordered something very hearty - Country Fried Steak , Eggs, and Cheesy Potatoes.\\n\\nThe food and coffee were good.    The service was excellent. \\n\\nI will go back.  \\n\\nBreakfast runs from $5-8.   \\n\\nMy breakfast cost me just over $10 - very comparable to Cracker Barrel / Bob Evans.',\n",
       " u\"This SnS and the one in Bethel Park are my two favorites.  Staff always friendly and the deli staff in both locations are great!  In my experience, if teen staff don't know where something is, they ask another staff member.  Shopping these two stores is as pleasant as it gets.\",\n",
       " u\"Typical BP. Usually pretty crowded in the evening due to location on Washington but never had to wait to long. Staff is pretty nice and always pleasant. Can't comment on the coffee or anything else because I only ever get gas.\",\n",
       " u'Station is closed.  Sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed.',\n",
       " u\"Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky's\",\n",
       " u\"I have been to this place a million times over the years. Have been there during the years it was less than clean, to the present where it is almost clean. This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. Fancy it is not. Gourmet it is definitely not. Every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. I have never had the same server twice. But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. Yes, the salad bar is very basic. Not every item is a fresh as it should be. The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what. However,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg. Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. In a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. Like we all do. A few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars. Rocky's is worth going to. You will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back. Decent food, decent price, good portions and an overall pleasant experience.\",\n",
       " u'Great local bar. Theresa does a great job. Sandwiches are excellent. Recommend meatball, reuben, burger, fish sandwiches.',\n",
       " u'Gab n Eat is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and always a treat.  We went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch. Vs breakfast debate. I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill. We also shared an order of potato pancakes. They even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. The pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good.',\n",
       " u\"Really just OK. It was chaotic and no one alerted us to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter, she gave us a dirty look like we weren't welcome there. Eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order. The server was nice enough, but wasn't very quick with the coffee refills - I finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minutes. Food was ok, but not amazing. We got the mixed grill and a pancake, and both were solid but not outstanding. \\nNot a bad place to go, but we probably won't go out of our way to go here again, either.\",\n",
       " u\"Sadly, I have only been here twice, only due to the fact it is not really close to my home or work. However, when I am in the area, this is a great cheap eats for both lunch and breakfast. Its almost like going back in time to where the old style local diners or Isaly's to get made to order diner style food. Love the eggs made perfectly to order and a variety of lunch offering at extremely affordable prices. I only wish Gab & Eat would move to my neighborhood.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is divey but cute. The food is obviously not five-star, but it's a great place if you want to get a good, hearty breakfast. We went there for lunch and got burgers...oddly enough the server said that they don't sell French Fries on Sundays.....? So we had to settle for home fries. I thought it was a little weird at first, but damn, those home fries were good! I didn't even care after that. The coffee is great too!\\nIt's a unique little place. It's basically one long strip of a kitchen, then booths set up right beside it! They also have a pretty cool breakfast bar where you can sit and watch them grill all of the food to order. The coffee cups didn't match - they were all Christmas mugs lol - they have a wall in the back where you can sign your name with a dry erase marker, and they have little trivia boards on the wall just for fun. It's definitely a place of it's own kind. The prices are very reasonable, and I would definitely go back again.\",\n",
       " u'Great food, great service, and a great \"diner\" atmosphere.  It\\'s the kind of place that allows you to decompress and enjoy good conversation with friends.',\n",
       " u\"Great diner. Some of the best breakfast sausage I've ever had. My wife didn't like how her omelet was prepared (it appeared they just took scrambled eggs and folded the omelet ingredients in the middle) but everything else was great including my son's pancake.\",\n",
       " u\"One of my favorite breakfast stops in Pittsburgh! Can't beat the hometown feel of this place. Always had great service.\",\n",
       " u\"We came here once before and remember it not being very good, but figured we'd give it another shot since it's pretty close to our home. It's still just OK. We didn't have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. Thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but's not a good way to end the meal when you're scrambling and digging for change. There are a lot of good diners in the area, so I doubt we'll be going back.\",\n",
       " u\"One of those places you only hear about from a friend...tucked in a strip mall...only open for breakfast and lunch. The local atmosphere surpasses the food and that's a helluva compliment.  \\n\\nMixed grill is the choice for breakfast.  They will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast. \\n\\nTheir burgers are up there with the best in Pittsburgh. \\n\\nA hidden gem. Don't miss it.\",\n",

       " u\"Great greasy spoon!\\n\\nArrived early, around 7:15 am on a weekday. Had no trouble finding a seat. Just as we were sitting down, a waitress asked if we wanted coffee. Of course, and how lovely!\\n\\nWe had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didn't want too much, as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge. The waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions. We ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill, and it was PLENTY!\\n\\nGreat diner quality, but I think I'll try the same dish without the cheese next time-it was an American cheese, and I don't think the grill needed it. \\n\\nCoffee was always hot, and service was so quick! This place is a hot spot!\\n\\nCash only - be prepared.\",\n",
       " u'Wonderful omelets, coffee, and staff! The prices are great and the food is prepared quickly! Veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite!',\n",
       " u\"My friend and i stopped in yesterday for breakfast. We originally came to Carnegie to eat at another new breakfast spot, but they had an hour wait and we had some retail therapy to handle stat. Gab & Eat crossed my mind since i had bookmarked it on yelp.. over 2 years ago. \\n\\nThere was a tiny wait here.. about 2 couples in front of us. Finally 2 seats at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there.\\n\\nSurprisingly we both ordered the same thing.. mixed grill. Mine had sausage links and she decided on bacon. \\n\\nIt was a blast watching all the food being made right before our eyes. Giant club sandwiches, super thick pancakes, eggs eggs and more eggs.. it was a fun time. \\n\\nThe restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good customer service and delicious food. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that i ordered my mixed grill with cheese. I thought it was going to be shredded cheddar, but they put 3 slices of american on it. Eh i'll know better next time.\",\n",
       " u'They have done it again! Excellent little establishment with their home town feeling. Mix match coffee mugs, smiling waitresses, open front diner kitchen feel. Went in there In the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast. It\\'s a seat your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what\\'s to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and \"Hey Rayed\" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well. I also got a cup the chicken poblano soup, pretty fantastic! Always a great place to travel to, always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals, always great and friendly. Highly recommend!',\n",

I got the turkey club on wholewheat...OMG...it was delish.  Too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made French Fries.  If you are really hungry and don't count calories...make a stop here.\",\n",

Room was only cleaned one time after asking three times when it would be cleaned. There was absolutely nothing in the supposedly full kitchen, 2 wash clothes, 2 hand towels and 2 towels. We had to take used wash clothes and towels to front desk every day to receive fresh ones. The toilet ran over and the heater didn't work until we decided to leave.

       " u\"So happy I found this place! I'm new to the Pittsburgh area and wasn't sure if it was worth driving to Carnegie to come here, but Yelp convinced me. It was completely worth the trip! Since it would have been a long trip to come back, the guys at Alteration World finished my work (patching a hole on a pair of jeans) in less than half an hour (I killed time at an adorable coffee shop across the street) and exactly as I had specified. Oh, and the price was extremely reasonable as well. Thanks Yelp for another great find!\",\n",
       " u'My bridesmaid dress alterations were perfect. I would not hesitate to come back for alterations or dry cleaning.',\n",
       " u'The service, quality, and speed of Alteration World are incredible! I have had suits and pants altered here and have been thoroughly impressed by the work. Everything has fit perfectly and the work was quality. I will be returning here exclusively for my tailoring needs and have referred many customers already. If you need anything altered (or even something custom made), do not hesitate to go to Alteration World.',\n",
       " u\"I really don't understand these reviews.  I have used Greetree Auto Body for years and they have been absolutely wonderful.  They are a preferred shop with most insurance companies and it is because they do very good work at reasonable prices.  I would highly recommend Greentree Auto Body to anyone.\",\n",
       " u\"I love LJS and have to agree, service was decent here. I tried a piece of my kid's chicken (I only ever get the fish for myself) and was pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat (same chicken texture as chick fil a). A little grimy dining room, and the bathroom handle is broken 8/2015... It would be nice if they made it an A&W-LJS but as-is still works for me.\",\n",
       " u\"I love LJS, but I  had to write a review regarding this particular location.  The inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for.  It smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door.  It took about 15 mins for the food, so I figured it was gonna be all fresh...negative!  The fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft.  The corn lacked butter.\\n\\nI didn't care for the onion rings and my boyfriend said the Coleslaw tasted spoiled.\\n\\nThe chicken planks and hushpuppies were the only things edible.  \\n\\nService wasn't too bad - nice people.  Too bad a whole bunch of flies started flying around the dining area and prep area, which ruined my appetite.\",\n",
       " u'My family (husband and 3 young children) have been seeing Dr. Weinberg for a few years. We\\'ve never had an issue. She\\'s great with the kids, even my 6 year old who has autism. Scheduling and rescheduling appts is \"fine\", the wait time is fine, the care is find. Basically I have had no issues, but I haven\\'t had my socks blown off either. It\\'s the dentist, it is what it is.',\n",
       " u\"All I need to say is that my 6 year old could not wait to see Dr. Weinberg and her staff! Not only are they professional and kind,  they have made my child have a life time of good oral health care!  This busy mom loves that they can provide two appointments, at the same time.  I can't imagine having a better family dentist!\",\n",
       " u\"Just moved to the area and needed a dentist after getting my front tooth chipped playing hockey.  She did an amazing job at fix my tooth and cleaned up the front teeth while doing it.  I was able to get in and have my tooth fixed within a few days of it happening.  I've gotten a few fillings as well after my chip was fixed.  The doctor is great and so are the staff.  I would recommend going here.\",\n",
       " u\"I use to order here fairly often.  The past 2 years their food has been getting progressively worse every time I order.  It doesn't help that the owner that always is at the register is so rude to me every time.  I finally decided that I'm done.  I don't think I should feel let an inconvenience when ordering food from a restaurant.  Let alone one that the food isn't even that good. Also the inside is dirty as heck.  They can deliver food in a BMW but they can't buy a scrub brush?  I have found Golden Dragon in Collier Square is 100 times better then Don Don.\",\n",
       " u\"The crew at West Penn Dental Centers is fantastic.  I'm always greeted with a smile at the front desk and everyone working there is very friendly.  Dr. Steines is an exceptional dentist and every one of the hygienists that have cleaned my teeth are exceptionally personable and well skilled at their craft.  The practice is small but clean and cozy.  A previous review claims that it's in a shady part of Carnegie.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  The office is on a nice street with a large parking lot just off of Main Street.  They also provide easy scheduling with email & text confirmations so you don't forget your appointment.  I highly recommend West Penn Dental.\",\n",
       " u'They gladly have you come in for a \"consultation\"/ cleaning just to tell you they work on children, but when you try to get actual work done on your child they all the sudden refer you to children\\'s. Good scam to get that cleaning visit from patients but don\\'t do any work. I will be looking for a dentist for all 3 of my boys that actually works.',\n",
       " u\"Good quality work and really nice staff. They definitely don't treat you like a number.\",\n",
       " u\"The office has been in Carnegie forever. I have been going there for years and have always had good direct communication about anything I need. My questions are always answered and I will continue with my dentist as long as he's there.\",\n",
       " u\"Dude... it's Denny's. It's excellent drunk food, packed on Sunday mornings, not very good.. but not really bad either. It's Denny's. When you walk into a Denny's.. you know exactly what you're getting into. Why the heck are you even reading reviews about a Denny's? That's like looking for reviews on an ice cream truck, you're getting the same thing no matter which one you choose.\",\n",
       " u'Excellent food , good service too I have had several different dishes here and all have been excellent',\n",
       " u\"Chose Denny's for a very late (1:30pm) Sunday brunch. No wait. Quickly greeted and served. I ordered the half size of Moon Over My Hammy. It was just the right amount of food for me, and the hash browns were delicious! Only thing lacking was Frank's Red Hot :-) Son and husband very pleased with their meals, can't remember the names but see pic. Patron next to us gave us $5 off $20 check, so our total came to $16! Would go back again for a casual meal.\",\n",
       " u\"I like the food at Denny's more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better.\",\n",
       " u\"I spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk, as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the business's part. He told me good luck and that I'm liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy. After two years at this gym I'm fed up with the way they treat their customers. He told me he was fed up with me since I gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago (which they've had towels since then). They never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and don't crash your car. Aside from that, this gym is well just that a gym. My biggest critic (aside from rude management and negligence) would have to be that they don't encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room. There aren't towels and spray around the weight machines, which I've never had an issue with, but I'd hate to see that happen. I always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine, cause well that'd be pretty nasty. It is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio. The workers well they're mostly young and don't really care too much (the man who told me I was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner). They tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isn't busy, which can be pretty annoying. Their cardio room always has Fox News on two tvs and then the middle TV has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv. They recently haven't even been putting pens games and stuff on. Must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably. If I had to pay full price for my membership I probably wouldn't belong here, but it's through my insurance. That said I don't swipe my card like most people in the front on my own. The machine is behind the counter. One guy always shows me how to do it myself, which was helpful the first time cause people aren't always around the front desk. That said when he is standing behind there chatting I would expect him to do it since it's his job. This gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy, but do you really need a fancy looking gym? Their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours I've never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical. They actually even have two hellix trainers, which aren't super common yet. Sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them. I've run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if I should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no they're useless. This gym makes a killing from a) classes b) it's convenient and c) their personal training is a separate company (warrior fitness). I've been meaning to sign up for a trainer and I always see them busy. They all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging. Not sure if they have a separate yelp page, but I would say from what I've seen they'd bust your ass for sure!\",\n",
       " u\"As a member for now 8 years I can honestly say, I have never had a negative experience at Amerifit!  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  \\nThere is another review on here stating the lot didn't have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we've had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone's car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.\\nI love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.  Amerifit has such a welcoming, no intimidation, home-like feel which is what I believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years.\",\n",
       " u\"Wonderful food. Some items a little over priced. But never disappointed.\\n\\nI have friends that LOVE the white pizza. I have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.\\n\\nI love their fresh salads. HUGE. The house dressing is perfect every time. We have been there many times and it just doesn't get old.\\n\\nWe always have the beans and greens. The meatball appetizer is superb. By-pass the chicken parm, it's the only thing we have ever found lacking....it's just really plain. The alfredo is excellent.\\n\\nWe, almost never go anywhere else in Carnegie because we like this place so much.\",\n",
       " u'I struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me. First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie\\'s main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. \\n\\nThe food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. \\n\\nNow the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. \\n\\nThe service - Our server was...well....I\\'m not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.\\n\\nOverall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine.',\n",
       " u'Many trips to Pittsburgh over 20 years.  First time here.  Had the gnocchi special.  One of the best Gnocchi I have ever had.  Pizza was excellent.  Service was great!',\n",
       " u\"Did dinner with my GF last Saturday at PaPa J's prior to going to the Off The Wall Theater. This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.\\n\\nThe place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.\\n\\nAfter viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.\\n\\nOver all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal. I only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner.\",\n",
       " u\"A unique and great find in downtown Carnegie. My fiance and I came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots. We had the sausage stuffed pepperoncini's as an appetizer (these are never my favorite and were just OK, but the marinara served with them was very tasty, as was their homemade bread), I had a really great wood fired meatball/ ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was FANTASTIC. Not overly sweet, crunchy-chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips. Amazing. We will definitely be back here!\",\n",
       " u\"We came to Carnegie to check out the Black Lamb consignment shop. Lucky for us that we also discovered PaPa J's--we loved it! The fried calamari appetizer was excellent, as was the fettuccine carbonara. We'll be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real Italian dining experience.\",\n",
       " u'Ok a few things. First we walked in and asked for a table and was told it would be 5 mins. So after 10 mins, we were seated and there was 10 tables that were open! Why the hell was there a wait??? The older man that took us to the table could have done nicer. The bread was great and that was about it. The food was not bad but it was not good.',\n",
       " u'I wrote a letter to the Papa J\\'s, but did not receive a reply therefore I will share my experience online.\\n\\nTonight a friend and I dined at your location. We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).\\n\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.\\nThe side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.\\n \\n  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. \\n \\n  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.\\nThe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and saut\\xe9ed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.\\nThe sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.\\n\\n  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.\\nI would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and \\nI saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.\\nI am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.  I hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business.',\n",
       " u\"This is it. My favorite in the Pittsburgh area. \\n\\nI moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get?!?\\n\\nI bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed. My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it's spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren't into a special, you'll be fine - order off the menu. But the specials are typically amazing. \\n\\nWhen my better half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town and I made him get back in he car to go here. Instead if complaining, he asked if we could take his parents next time.\",\n",
       " u'Stopped in for lunch after I got lost due to construction in the area. Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust. I asked the waiter if I should order it well done and he said order it as is. He was correct and it came out perfect.   The waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave.',\n",
       " u\"I gave them 4 stars for two reasons - 1) they do not have fresh pasta and 2) my boyfriend's chicken Abruzzo was dry. The service was attentive and the bread was amazing. My Carbonara was incredible! The main dining room was a nice grotto style reminiscent of Rome; nice for couples and girlfriends catching up on life. I loved the Montpluciano in a carafe, but don't miss the extensive Italian wine list. We will definitely return to this Carnegie gem!\",\n",
       " u'Yummy Yum, Let me get me some.  This place rocks!!! Went here with the wife and had a great dinner.  Portions are very generous and the food is delicious.  Be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees, but they are worth every penny!',\n",
       " u\"Great restaurant. Had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was very good. Bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time. Prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting. Can't wait to go back.\",\n",
       " u\"We recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at Papa J's. There is a parking lot in the back of the building and the entrance is on the side. The food was perfectly prepared, served at the proper temperature, and was quite delicious. Portion sizes were quite satisfying. The complimentary bread and oil was excellent. The service was polite and efficient.\",\n",
       " u'Had dinner with a friend. My friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage. The waitress was extremely rude. He never did get the correct meal. When We talked to the manager, his answer  was .,\"well what do you want me to do fire the waitress?\" Too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude!',\n",
       " u\"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife and 3 other couples.  Another couple in our party had made reservations before hand and when we arrived a couple of minutes after that time, we were immediately taken to our table.  Whenever you first walk into Papa Js you immediately head past both their dessert case and bread making area.  That is pure genius on their part as both their desserts and bread look good!  Then to get to our table we also walked past a bar and up a flight of stairs.  After that I didn't really see much else of the restaurant.\\n\\nAfter our whole party had arrived and our waitress had taken all of our drink orders she came back up to our table and promised us that she would be back shortly as she had some desserts to take to a table.  After about 15 minutes or so she finally did make it back to our table.  For my dinner entree I decided on having the Romano chicken.  It came out a short time later with a side of broccoli.  The chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty.  I can take at least some credit for that though as I may have used the Parmesan that was on the table quite liberally.  Meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever I bit into it.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  I wouldn't be the person to recommend it but I also wouldn't turn it down.  I feel like the prices were fair for what you got and only wish that the service was a little better.\",\n",
       " u\"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!  Reasonable prices & delicious food.  Only one weird quirk - they don't bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, but it doesn't come automatically). \\n\\nEverything is super fresh - my friends & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don't offer side portions) - I strongly recommend the panzanella salad.  \\n\\nThen, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good!  \\n\\nIf you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  Definitely enough to share (probably with a large table).\",\n",
       " u'We visited on 11/15 with a party of 15.  While I know a party of 15 can be overwhelming, we did call in advance for reservations. Thus, allowing proper staffing. We arrived early and headed to the bar. The bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us. When it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately. That is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst. We sat for 20 minutes before a server came to our table. At that point, she said I\\'ll grab you water and bread.  Another 10 minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished (still no water or bread). She finally comes back to the table with bread (no waters) and takes our drink orders (about 40 mins into sitting at the table). Next thing we know, a nice gentleman by the name of Patrick is our NEW server. He really stepped up the service and should be commended. However, we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold. We also ordered the \"incredible white pizza\" which was incredibly cold. While Patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible.\\nNot once did the front of house manager come check on us. \\nThis is the second time I\\'ve visited and the 2nd time I\\'ve been disappointed.\\nAlso, I wrote to the restaurant and received no response.',\n",
       " u\"I've never posted a yelp review before.  This meal was so horrible that I downloaded the yelp app just so I could warn others to stay away!  We ordered food from Capri since we were going to voodoo brewery.  We ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an Italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones.  We ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an Italian wedgie, which was just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onions.  No sign of Italian meat to be found.  No marinara sauce.  It was inedible.  We ended up walking to kfc instead.  \\n\\nI want to leave a zero star rating, but yelp won't let me.  So they get an undeserved star.\",\n",

I LOVE the food, the prices are great and I think I'm addicted to their cheesesteaks! The staff is always funny and down to earth, they make delivery to my job speedy, and they even deal with my indecisiveness! (haha). If something was wrong with my food, I am sure they'd waste no time fixing the problem.\\nI always order a side of fries as they're HUGE and taste like Potato Patch (Kennywood) UHH-MAY-ZIIING.

       " u\"I judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni.  While grabbing a brew at Voodoo, my friends and I were feeling a bit hungry.  Thankfully a menu was available and Capri pizza was just across the street. \\n\\nWe ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The cheese was not greasy, the sauce was flavorful, and the dough was chewy yet crunchy... what more could you ask for?  We were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from Capri.\\n\\nNext time we'll try the pepperoni and post an update.  I see yummy pizza in our future.  If you're grabbing a pint a Voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly, order something cheesy at Capri Pizza in Homestead.\",\n",

       " u\"I like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great. But this location is always woefully understaffed, with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated. Whether you're inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long. Fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here.\",\n",
       " u\"I am not a fan of this chain's food or this locations service.\\n\\nHowever!  \\n\\nSteak n Shake milkshakes totally rock.  Very thick, regular is the perfect size to get me home from the Waterfront.\",\n",
       " u\"I really don't know how this place stays open. I've been here a couple of times. The service is slooooow. They bring you your food which is never the way you ordered it, put your Bill on the table and never come back to check on you. If the place was packed I could understand but it's usually about half full. On our last visit it took us 10 minutes to get our waitresses attention. We asked for some mustard, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes for our burgers. It took 5 minutes to get the mustard and mayo. The lettuce and tomato never came. \\nIt's safe to say that we won't be back. We like the food and shakes but not worth it to put up with the poor service.\",\n",

From the \"why do you want(with accompanied eye roll) \" For no other reason than \"she was doin five people\\'s jobs\" ...I do five people\\'s jobs sometimes and that\\'s no excuse for how she treated , and it\\'s treating me as I write this in front of her.

       " u'Drive through service is better than going inside if you want takeout. Food is always served hot- inside it just takes a lot longer than it should, both to get waited on at the counter and for the food to come. Also, the lids on the milkshake cups are awful and fall off easily. Make sure to hold on tight!',\n",
       " u\"The hostess (Jenn of Jess, I'm not sure) is atrocious. I am autistic and asked to be moved from right beside the kitchen because of noise levels, and she made a huge deal of it. I ended up crying outside waiting for my partner to let me know we'd been moved. 15 minutes later, we had still not been moved or gotten food, and my partner and I left. This is 1:45 PM on a Thursday. Not at all busy. Just bad service. Our waitress was very polite, though.\",\n",
       " u\"I have eaten here before and never had any problems. But today was completely different. I arrived 12:15 PM to have lunch with my family. We sat there for about 25 minutes and not one person came to ask us if we were ready to order. They completely ignored us so we got up and left. One table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention. So we went to  Wendy's up on 8th Avenue and we had no problems ar all.\",\n",
       " u'Slow service. Food is VERY cheap though. The milkshakes are huge thick and yummy. Sometimes when I go here, they completely ignore you when your the only person in line. The burgers were good and the menu is pretty small. Food takes about an hour to come when no ones even there! I would go here if the service was faster and better.',\n",

       " u\"Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go.

       " u'My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \"Rock Bottom\" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy\\'s bachelor party.\\n\\nThere were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it\\'s not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren\\'t so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I\\'ll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it.',\n",

       " u'Stopped in at Sing Sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends. The entertainment was fun. The guys do a great job singing, playing the instruments, and keeping the crowd pleased. Sing Sing is attached to The Rock Bottom Brewery so they have house beers. I did have the sampler and I enjoyed all six beers I sampled. What a great place to hang out. I highly recommend.',\n",

       " u\"Amazing repair service. I hit a really fat raccoon in the Appalachians (it was dark and rainy and I didn't see the poor thing until it was too late) while going fairly fast down a hill. The raccoon destroyed my front bumper, the grill, and my right fog light. Thankfully I had duct tape in my trunk. Anyway, once I got back to Pittsburgh, I called my insurance agent.\\n\\nMy insurance referred me to DiIorios and I'm really glad they did! The staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate.

It's convenient and local to me. \\nCustomer service is always great and prices are fair. \\nMy most recent experience with customer service was AMAZING. So a hose burst on my hot tub. Call repair guy or try to fix it myself? I gave it a go. Took pictures of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section. I showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help. He didn't have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot. My fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temps. Back to plumbing section. Same gentleman. Gave me the advice again and bam, fixed! \\nTHIS is what I want in customer service. Sadly, I cannot remember his name. (Bad customer on my part.) Thank you!!!\",\n",
       " u\"Lowe's is my first stop for all of my home projects.   I am currently redoing door.  Lowe's has knowledgeable employees that offer advice to the DIYs as well as a stable of contractors to hire out the big jobs.   Returns are handled seamlessly,  who doesn't grab the wrong part?  Their garden section is great for Spring planting.  They have competatively priced appliances.  5% off with Lowe's credit card is also nice.  Having those large items delivered is a convenience. Their best asset is the expertise of the staff.  I frequently change mind on an original concept based on their input.   Highly recommended\",\n",
       " u'One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family.',\n",
       " u'Came back tonight after a hiatus and missing out on getting food from the Franktuary truck at Voodoo Homestead. I was going to get a burger until I saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on Saturday evenings. For $19 you got a large cut of meat, which was pretty tasty, a large side salad, and I chose a loaded baked potato for the side. They were a little chintzy with the sides. The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus. I asked for a horseradish sauce, which they had, but the container was so small I had to ask for another. It was a similar situation with the large side salad. It was pretty big, and required at least a second side of dressing. The food was all pretty good, with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear. As always, the beer selection was pretty solid and I really enjoyed my East End Brewery Monkey Boy.',\n",
       " u\"We recently ordered fish sandwiches from here. They were HUGE! We did get the large, but it was so big we could've just shared one. \\n\\nWas not over fried. The French fries were hot and also very good. We will definitely be going again to try something different.\",\n",
       " u\"If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.  A locals favorite they've seen a lot of growth since I started going 10 years ago.   They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.  \\n\\nMy favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.  \\n\\nI've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints.\",\n",
       " u\"Went to Dukes last week. They have really renovated the place, and added a lot of large screen tv's. The best part, tho, is the vast improvement in draft beer selection. I counted 46 beers on tap. If you are a beer head and are at the Waterfront shopping are, this is definitely one of your best choices.  The food is above average, and the selection is common pub fare.\",\n",
       " u'I find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing. I eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great. I have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad meal. Great draft and great service. This is the best bar in this area.',\n",
       " u\"I went to Duke's Upper Deck Cafe recently and overall really enjoyed my visit.  I went there to watch an Elite 8 game, and felt a little out of place as I was the only person in the bar that didn't seem to know everyone who was there.  However, that quickly went away because the regulars and bar staff were extremely friendly and made the entire game more enjoyable (I was cheering for my alma-matter from outta state and they all encouraged me to enjoy the game and not worry about bothering them if I was loud).  \\n\\nThe drinks were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer options. The food was just OK.  I ordered the wings, which were very good in a unique way.  The sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wings come submerged in it. Initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them I can see why people love them, messy but delicious. I also ordered the pita pizza, i would not recommend this as it just wasn't very good.  \\n\\nI am looking forward to returning to Duke's this summer when I can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wings.\",\n",
       " u'The chili dogs rock!  The portions are huge so come hungry.  Big selection of appetizers that go beyond the standard bar food list.  Great selection of draft beer.  Noise level is good for lunch but may be loud for dinner.',\n",
       " u'Love dukes and love the food. I wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings. Their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domestic',\n",
       " u\"I really don't see how anyone could give this place a bad review.  The food is fantastic and if it's not my belly luring me in then it's the awesome beer selection they have.  \\nMy suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night... Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu...\\nThey often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)\\nAnyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food!\",\n",
       " u\"My boys and I stopped here for dinner one night. It was cold and dreary outside but warm and homey in here.  Our server was extremely nice. The menu had lots of options. They are kind of known for their potato soup so that's what I had. It is very good. It's a very thick soup that is velvety smooth. I would definitely order it again. It was perfect for a rainy night. \\nMy youngest son had chicken tenders. They looked a little over cooked but I tasted one and it was good. The coating was crispy and the chicken was juicy. My older son ordered wings with their house made sauce. It was good but not spicy enough for him. I thought it was good and would order it the next time I go.\",\n",
       " u'Had corned beef sandwich. Meh. \\n\\nOnion rings were horrible. Extremely breaded and doughy. Greasy as all get out. I hope the chef will take the hint when all of the breading comes back, as I had to peel it away to get to the onion.',\n",
       " u\"We checked in at 7:00 pm on a Saturday with a group of 19 for a birthday gathering.  We were originally told 9:00 pm is when we'd be seated, but that's not the problem, because we were able to play before being seated.  We ACTUALLY didn't get seated until 10:00 pm, only to be told the kitchen was taking 3 hours for people's orders.  Didn't see a manager until after 10:30 pm.  Needless to say, we didn't stay to eat and went elsewhere.\",\n",
       " u'Ok, we went on a sat night with a large party, 2 hour wait for a table. Fine that\\'s understand then it turned to a three hour wait. Once seated we were told the kitchen was THREE HOURS behind and the wait for food would be three hours. The manger blamed us saying \" you came with a large party on a sat night, if you only order apps and not separate  meals, you MIGHT get food in 45 min\" really ? It\\'s the customers fault your staff can\\'t handle a sat night rush. The table of 5 next to us waited 3 hours for food, when they got it it was the WRONG food... I will never spend money here again!!!\\nTo top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there was pee everywhere!',\n",
       " u\"This is a really fun way to spend an afternoon. After several visits here, I've found a couple games that are easy to win and score you lots of tickets, and others that are just a blast to play. We did really awesome last time we were here, and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff. \\n\\nTheir food is not too bad. I've only ever eaten here once, and it wasn't that memorable, but I didn't hate it. I did like that they have a bar, and they had my favorite beer on tap, that was nice. \\n\\nLike pretty much any arcade I've ever been to, there are things that are a rip off, and occasionally something won't work properly. That really irritates some people but I figure no arcade is perfect. At least none that I've ever been to. The most irritating thing for me is that some of the games have a call button on them that signals an employee to come assist you, and I kept hitting the button with my leg or something, so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if I needed help, and I would be really confused. haha. \\n\\nWe went here with my husband's family on Thanksgiving, and we had a total blast. The whole place was pretty empty, and I felt really bad for the employees that had to work that day, but it was nice for us!\",\n",
       " u'Awful awful. Spent 150.00SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. Took 27 minutes to even be acknowledged. Really. The only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took AMAZING care of us......',\n",

Nice Bash Kiss FM...!',\n",
       " u\"4 Stars for the fun factory, games, and all around experience, but 2 stars for the disgusting food and horrible service!\\n\\nI was SO excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday. Its always fun to play games, win tickets, and have fun with friends/family. We decided to eat here before we played. I keep seeing commercials for their new menu, so hey it couldn't be bad right? Wrong! Only thing that was really good was the Corona-rita - but that's hard to mess up. \\n\\nFirst off, service was horrible. I didn't feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently I was wrong. It took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. At least an hour for our food. I have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine weren't bad but they weren't the best. My boyfriend had their Philly Cheesesteak and he couldn't finish it. Was SO salty and just not good. For the price of everything, it was not worth it all. Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play. You'll save $$, time, and frustration! \\n\\nI guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make-shift area to cash in your tickets. Everything was pretty picked over, which kinda sucked. Overall it was still fun, and I am sure I will be back to play some more games!\",\n",
       " u\"The service at the Pittsburgh location was so incredible awful that I actually took the time out of my day to write online how disappointed I was, which I have never done before. It was a Saturday night and as someone who works in a restaurant im very sympathetic when it comes to service. We sat at the high tables in the bar area and we did not get greeted or even acknowledged for 30 minutes. I personally had to get a manager and explain to him the situation and he treated me like I was stupid (maybe because im 17?) Also not to mention the little girl next to me is balling her eyes out because she told her server of an egg allergy she has and they still managed to mess it up and give her food marinated in egg. Last I overhead they are heading to the hospital. I'm not writing this message to be spiteful, I'm writing it in hopes that the future of your restaurant will improve. There's a big difference between service and hospitality and right now this place is lacking both. My best wishing for improvement\",\n",
       " u\"Can we get a maintenance man?  And a janitor?  And a manager?   No?  Ok...\\n\\nI had a good time at Dave and Buster's, but that was based mainly on the company I kept and not the venue.   We went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  She radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  When she came back, she said she couldn't find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.   \\n\\nAll but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn't work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   \\n\\nAnd we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).\\n\\nOverall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.  The broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  If you are really looking to do this type of activity, I'd try a different location for sure.\",\n",
       " u'Worst experience at a restaurant, waited 45 minutes for a waitress to come over and tell us that they changed a rule and that to eat in the game room you needed to be with someone over 25, when we had eaten there 2 days prior without any problems, when 2 of us are legally adults, will never go back to this place, I highly recommend red robin across the street.',\n",
       " u\"Over priced, over hyped but a hell of a time regardless.  I think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friends over and have the same experience without the price and glitz.  I've yet to eat something here that impressed me.  The arcade is a bit dated but I like playing the big trivia game more than anything (again, you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit).  The new TV set up is pretty cool, but Dave and Busters is just what it is, an adult Chuckie Cheese not worth more than a visit a year, if that.\",\n",
       " u\"I've probably only been to 3 Dave & Buster's in my life, but this is probably my favorite one. It's a lot bigger and has more variety of games than the other 2 I've been to, though they pretty much have the same games. The prizes are also better here, and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too. Definitely take advantage of the half priced games on Wednesdays!!!\\n\\nI don't come for the food, since it's very average. With all these good restaurants close by, why don't just eat somewhere else and come for the games?\",\n",

Our food took 25 minutes yet there was only 4 table with people who were dining. Grilled cheese, salad and a quesadilla shouldn't take that long. Games were fine. Mens room didn't have any paper towels to dry hands with. Huge fail for this type of venue.\",\n",
       " u'I have been to Dave and Busters multiple times and i feel its a 2 star place.\\n\\nI can say the food quality is sub par.  In my opinion the food prices are expensive for what it is and quality.  They do offer a nice bar,but then again the prices in my opinion are a little higher.  Service isn\\'t too bad, but could be better.\\n\\nD&B is a great place for adults for sure, but the prices for tokes or \"game play\" is a little ridiculous.  Some games charge 6.9 credits to place.  Thats almost saying $1.50 a game and some of those games are addicting where I know most of us keep playing.  \\n\\nI also thing D&B isn\\'t the cleanest place either.  The bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion.  Doesn\\'t seem like they keep up with it.  To me, thats a big factor in rating restaurants.   \\n\\nAll in all, D&B is an ok place to visit, but not a place i would frequently waste my money.',\n",
       " u'We had our reunion banquet last weekend at this D&B. It was the highlight of our gathering. The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility.\\n\\nKids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience.',\n",
       " u\"This wasn't the cleanest place. Dirty paper towels all over the women's bathroom. No changing covers on the changing tables to change your Babies. Very disappointed when I came here compared to the other two I've been too. Also they aren't following corporate policy. Which ok, but when I asked about it to one of the managers on the way out, he said he didn't honor the first responders discount like the other stores do. Which ok Is fine, but he had a very sore attitude towards them. Very disappointed in his attitude more then anything.\",\n",
       " u\"I gave D&B 4 stars because our waiter was very geniune and nice! The place has definitely changed over the years, becoming a very pricey venue. The food was mediocre. The fries were cold and the sliders were subpar, almost like White Castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores. My buffalo wings were rather tough. As for the games, they were mostly the same, but included a lot of the newer 'app' style games like flappy bird. Skeeball and Free throw were still fun, along with the coin drop machines. But, wow, we went through $50 of games really fast. The gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points! Nevertheless, it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family, friends or coworkers.\",\n",

       " u\"The food here is awful.  I came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the Waterfront.  We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.\\n\\nI only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese.  Everyone else at the table hated their food.  They all had sandwiches or other dishes.  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our table's food.\\n\\nI was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.  All I have to say is no thanks.\",\n",
       " u'The food was good but we Waited an hour for our drinks then 1.5 hours food then an hour for our bill. Won\\'t be back! Not busy at all so not sure what the problem was. I\\'d hate to be there when they are \"busy\".',\n",
       " u\"Worst service I've ever had! we waited for over an hour for our food. After the waitress walked by 6 times without saying a word or refilling our drinks we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give us a round but never said a word about our food. And told us her help never showed up. We waited another 30 mins for our food before we asked for the check for the 2 drinks we got. We left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food. No apologies nothing. While sitting there we noticed 2 other parties walked out as well. They didn't even get their drinks.\\nI would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat. Drink play games fine. I will never order food there again.\",\n",
       " u\"Went to Dave and busters to eat.... NO FOOD. Went to Dave and busters to play.. NO GAMES. Then I thought I'd wet my whistle with a cool glass of H2O..they even RAN OUT OF WATER...

       " u\"This is a place I'd go to just for the games. The food was bad. I had the chicken sliders and there was two pieces of wood in the sandwich which I found in my mouth. Granted the manager did take off the price of the sliders but everyone's fries were lukewarm. My sister got the chicken fingers and wow, there was zero flavor or seasoning on it. The bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky. The waitress was nice but overall i wouldn't dine here again.\",\n",

The food wasn't bad but our service was overwhelmed so we didn't really have a server, and there were a couple small errors with our order. The bathroom was a wreck, like always. The trash can is always full, floors filthy, and smells strongly of urine. Half of the games I played wouldn't read my card on the first try.\\n\\nBartenders were slow & didn't seem to care, except for the manager. \\n\\nI'll be back for sure but this place needs some serious staff updating.\",\n",

I could not be happier, especially because the people at Petco claimed he needed to be completely shaven because they didn't have the time for it being it was a busy Saturday. Paws in the Family Pet Grooming actually cared and took the time with him and he because of that he got to keep his beard, his chest-fur, and the fur on his legs. He looks like a Schnauzer!

I guess convenience gets dollars but after so long, you'll stop getting mine.\\n\\nThe employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register.  The management isn't any better telling me to go somewhere else if I don't like it then.  This place is the reason people scoff at giving $15 a hr to fast food employees.  The frosty is never frosty always runny.  The burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat.\\n\\nThe only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back.\",\n",

Was given a time frame or 45-50min for delivery, after waiting an hour we called and was told food was on the way they sent the delivery guy out with 6 orders. After another 30min we called back and was told pizza was still there because they ran out of part of our order. They said they'd bring it right away. Waited another 20min we live about 1.5 miles away from the place still nothing. So we called back and asked for our money back. They never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter. And oh since we used a card it's going to be 3-4 days to see the refund. At least pay cash so when they don't show you know you won't be ripped off at least.\",\n",

We have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visits but for the most part, service is EXCELLENT and the food is consistent!  After leaving another restaurant (just trying to do something new for a celebration) because of poor service, we were greeted and seated in a few seconds!  Our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large (10 to 12 guests) Group at the table near us. We had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within 5 minutes. Our food came out rather quickly and was delicious! Our server was very attentive and social. As usual, a save by our go to place! I know we will retun here again!',\n",
       " u\"Nice enough chain restaurant.  Have ordered the fish tacos appetizer and the dinner entree of cajun fish tacos which comes with black beans and rice.  Both are ok, though I think I'd order something else next time as I'm pretty picky about fish tacos.  \\n\\nThe appetizer tacos were rather dry.  The cajun tacos were much better but executed oddly.  They come in 2 shells -- an inner hard shell and an outer soft shell.  Why might I ask?  Why add extra calories for something that seems so unnecessary and doesn't add to the dish in any way.  \\n\\nOh, well.  Can't speak about beer here as I'm not a beer drinker.\\n\\nThe space is pleasant and our server was efficient even if the meal wasn't the quickest to come to our table even though it wasn't busy.\\n\\nWould I revisit?  Probably; it was decent enough with many other menu options.  Keep in mind, however, that there are many options nearby worthy of a visit.\",\n",
       " u'Standard issue Rock Bottom.  We ordered the nachos....they could have easily served 6 people.  I have never seen a more massive platter of food.  Bar service was okay...guy working there was nice to talk to about sports.',\n",
       " u\"On a Friday I went to Rock Bottom with some friends for their happy hour which takes place from 4-6. Our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding. I ultimately decided on the Pom-berry Cosmo which was excellent. I also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing. During happy hour it's only $5 and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip. My friends got the nachos, the quesadilla, and the artichoke cheese dip. Everything was very tasty.\",\n",
       " u\"For this occasion I was with my girls, we were looking for a place to have a good lunch.  We looked around and chose Rock Bottom, we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves.  The server was a very nice person and was very attentive.  She when over the specials and took our drink order.   Going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the BBQ Brisket Stuffed Burger.  That just sounded so good.  Unfortunately the reality didn't match the idea of the burger.  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent. It was like having a standard old boring burger.  I was very disappointed.  For $14, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor.\",\n",
       " u\"My visits here are generally pretty consistent.  I love getting the beer sampler even though I've drank all the beers twice over.  I wouldn't say I have a favorite dish here yet but the food was always generally good.  I guess one thing that sticks out is the chicken mac and cheese and the Reuben.  \\n\\nWhen I go here though, I'm going for the beer more than the food.  Definitely worth a trip for dinner.\",\n",
       " u\"First, I have to say that I've been here twice in the past few months, and each time was with a very large group (one group of 20, one group of over 30) on a weekend evening and I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch.\\n\\nThat being said, the food and beer aint all that bad either! Fish & Chips, chicken mac'n cheese, salmon bites, guacamole and the Maker's Mark burger are all quite good, as are the beers (the K\\xf6lsch is my favorite!).\",\n",
       " u\"There are few local restaurants as popular as this place, the food is consistently good and the service always great. I meet people regularly at the bar, we usually have dinner but lately that's not always the case. The biggest complaint is that it seems the chef is intent on putting black pepper or some type of hot spice in all menu items.\",\n",
       " u\"Overpriced. Food is OK, but way overpriced. Quantities are small....much smaller than the picture in the menu. The beer is average. But yes, you guessed it, that's overpriced too.\",\n",
       " u\"It's been a couple years since I first reviewed Rock Bottom, and while I still don't love the place they've definitely improved since then. They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.\\n\\nThat said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \\n\\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\\n\\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks. And for that, Rock Bottom's earned another star in my book.\",\n",
       " u\"Was hoping for a great end of a day experience, but...... Things happen. Waitress seemed to have forgotten about us, entrees came out prior to our appetizers. Entree of fish &chips was a major disappointment, fish was soggy and the chips were cold and grainy.starters were comp'ed but I doubt we'd go back. Sad because it has the potential to be a home run hitter. Two stars and that's it.\",\n",
       " u'Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelper\\'s Tale.\\n\\nYou might say, \"I\\'ve never heard of Rock Bottom, there\\'s no way that they are a chain restaurant.\" Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you\\'ll end up on the rock bottom.\\n\\nAfter a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn\\'t right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.\\n\\nWe waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service. \\n\\nSo if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.',\n",
       " u\"Great bar. Great atmosphere. Great food. Cool place to be.\\n\\nDefinitely one of those places you could keep going back just because it's so chill and it's a great place for friends to just enjoy some drinks and eat some good food. Nothing too too spectacular by any means but satisfies the taste buds. Their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant, in my opinion. The nachos can be split among 4-5 people easy. Lots of toppings and yummy all around.\",\n",
       " u\"While this is certainly not my first meal at Rock Bottom, this is my first meal in a year or two . The wait was minuscule, and the greeter was pleasant. As always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores, the mother in law and I decided to tie the feed bag on at RB. Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative. \\n\\nI started off with the tortilla soup. Spicy and thick it went down easy enough. However let me say that the price at $3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steaks'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was 'buffaloed' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... Hmmm. \\n\\nThey say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!  \\n\\nMy meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!! \\n\\nThe final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash. If anyone from Rock Bottom corporate reads this... You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes. \\n\\nAs you know I vote with my feet and dollars, and neither will be there again ANY time soon!!\",\n",
       " u\"This is another one of my favorite places that had deteriorated dramatically. Corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck. The menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great. The service has also suffered tremendously. We are abandoning this restaurant.\\n\\nI don't expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  Alas, I don't think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months.  Hopefully, if that happens, Black Rock Bar & Steak House will find its way into Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! \\n\\nI was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.\\n\\nEverything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.\\n\\nThe Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.\\n\\nIn the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.\",\n",
       " u\"Stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar. The bar tender was quick to get me a beer (the 3 Pepper Ale which was really good) but after that I was totally ignored. Tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer. They seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses. I got feed up, finished my beer, paid my tab and went to Uno's. Glad I did... Got great service and my meal came quickly.\\n\\nVerdict:  sit at the bar for a beer if that's what you want but if you're hungry and want dinner take your chances at a table.\",\n",
       " u'For a chain, it is better atmosphere than you would expect.  The menu options all sound delicious, but the food quality is not great.  Just mediocre.',\n",
       " u'Service is good, staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Beer and cocktails are good as well. Food...not so much.  My boyfriend and I shared the Jalapeno Pretzel appetizer which was pretty good, but our entrees.... disappointing.  I got the Baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger.   both were super dry. i could not even finish half of mine. He had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down. If i were to go back, it certainly would not be to eat.',\n",
       " u'Meh is the only thing I leave here feeling.  I ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me.  For a side,  I requested the seasonal veggies (trying to be healthier) and was told it\\'s a squash mixture - great I love summer squash!  \\n\\nI received a poorly seasoned burger. The bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement.  It was topped with an olive and a mini pickle... odd.  My \"squash\" side was lacking squash. Instead all squash was replaced by peppers... which I cannot eat.\\n\\nOur server was nice.  The beer was simple.  With new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around Homestead, perhaps RB should reconsider their flavors.',\n",
       " u'Apps were good, service was average, and the certified angus beef tips were awful.  They were severely overcooked and the sauce they were in had no flavor.  The picture on the menu made it appear you get a good amount of tips.  However, I was given only 4 tips, which in the end I was thankful for, because if I had any more, I would have had to rest my jaw for a couple days due to the extreme toughness and amount of chewing required to swallow those flavorless tips.',\n",
       " u'Great american style bar food with quite a lot to pick from the both the food and drink menus. They are also great at accommodating large groups and these are one of the few places that allow you to call ahead to reserve a spot.

       " u\"I am a FAN of rock bottom.  This is my 2nd time here and i can say i am a FAN.  We went on a Saturday night after a day at sandcastle.  The wait was 45-60 mins for a table of 5 which was to be expected on a saturday evening. \\n\\nOur server wasn't the best in my opinion.  She was very friendly and some what attentive but it definitely took awhile to place our orders in for our drinks, appetizers, and meals.  \\n\\nSince we were all hungry, I ordered us the nachos.  They were AWESOME.  Very happy and pleased with that selection. My sister ordered pretzels which were pretty good,but the clearly had TOO much salt on them.  The cheese dip that came with the pretzels however was AWESOME.  Definetly pleased with our selection.\\n\\nWe placed our order, which came out in a timely fashion.  Everyone was pleased.  The prices for the meal were about average for everything that you got.  I got the the margarita pizza which was pretty good.  My wife got jalpeno burger with fries.  My son got the kids pizza.  My sister and her husband got the seafood taco with shrimp and crab i believe.  The best part of this place is that they brew their own beer here.  Everyone got a honey beer (can't remember the exact kind) but it was 7.75 for 25oz which was a fair price i think.  \\n\\nAll in all, its def a place worth going.\",\n",
       " u\"Good beer, food and service. Arrived on a Wednesday night for business and sat at the bar. Bartender was attentive and nice. Food was great. I had the Bison Prairie Burger. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor and fries were great. I'll be coming here again on my next business trip.\",\n",
       " u\"The food is always plentiful, the atmosphere lively, the service friendly, and even though it's always busy, I rarely have to wait for a table. \\n\\nIf you're a nachos fan, this is the place! Often, I just make it my appetizer, salad, and meal. Yes, it's that big. \\n\\nEven though I'm not a big beer drinker, I enjoy their sampler, and I LOVE their cider; it had just the right amount of kick.\",\n",
       " u'They did a good job accommodating a large group. Mac N Cheese with chicken and bacon was good. In house beers were moderate and selection was limited. Good service, franchise-ish ambiance, nothing extraordinary but easy enough.',\n",
       " u\"Loved the American Blonde and gram's oat soda IPA.  Good service.    Egg rolls were very good.  Our bar tender was very attentive and helpful in selecting the beers.\",\n",
       " u\"If your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option. They have a nice seasonal selection and it's all tap which I prefer. I also like that most of the seating is booth. On my visit the service was lack luster. I have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skills left much to be desired. I went with a beer sampler. It was nice being able to try everything they have. I of course went with the pumpkin beer. For my main dish I had stuffed peppers which I honestly enjoyed. They had a great flavor. My only issue is the rice that came with it was a bit under cooked. If service was better and my rice was cooked I would have given this place a solid 4 stars but that unfortunately wasn't the case on this particular visit.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm visiting Homestead this week for some work-related training.  Rock Bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel, and I'm so glad it was!  I've been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don't know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!\",\n",
       " u'Came here on a Saturday night. Waited over an hour for a table for 2, but enjoyed some great beers from the bar while waiting. Ordered the calamari appetizer to start which was very good. My fish and chips entree was cold, but my boyfriends 2 am burger was phenomenal.',\n",
       " u'Very disappointing menu. Pseudo Mexican and south of the border fare. I had the Beef Tip Sliders. What a ridicules offering. Each one (2 on a plate) had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong  3\" bun. It was taken back to the kitchen, after I complained, and a thin sliver now appeared. The only thing good about this experience, the waiter was nice!\\nAs the raven said, \"Never, never more.\"',\n",
       " u'We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. \\nI had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. \\nI would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back.',\n",

The owner called me at 645 am the next day and gave me attitude for leaving it in his parking lot. He told me he wouldn\\'t work on the vehicle and that I had to pick it back up by the end of the day. I said this was a secondary vehicle and I asked if he could be fixed at his earliest convenience, he said \"it doesn\\'t work like that\".  Never going back again  and I would advise against Master Muffler to all others.',\n",
       " u\"It's sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy acts (other than the big 'uns in the Cultural District). I hate this place's M.O. The space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. They bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. But the two item minimum just infuriates me. Overpriced, shitty food and drinks. We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night (hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our CD and posed for photos with people). We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday's would have been better. I've been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality.  The Improv's saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets.\",\n",

       " u\"Went to see Bret Ernst (one of my fave Comedians).  Tickets say seating begins at 9pm for the 9:30pm show.  Well, a line had formed outside because they hadn't opened the doors.  That is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees.  People stood out there upwards of 20 minutes, freezing.  They didn't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready.  Seating is first come, first served.  Whoever designed this place should be shot.  There is no lobby to hold people before a show.  The Improv in Cleveland is superb.  That location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you.  The Pittsburgh Improv is a disaster layout-wise.  Beverage service was fine.  It got really, really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show.  Of course Bret and Bill Crawford were as hilarious as ever but man, this Improv, as a comedy venue, sucks.\",\n",
       " u\"We've been to the improv comedy club twice now and both shows were amazing; even the opening acts! \\n\\nThe only downfall is the two drink minimum, which I understand, but their prices make it ridiculous. We stuck to beer because we knew it wouldn't be watered down. Our waitress was horrible. We did not have an opportunity to order our second drinks until the other waitresses were bringing out checks. If our waitress was more attentive, the club could have made more money off of us. Oh well. \\n\\nI would recommend eating at a restaurant before the show because the food menu is limited and overpriced. \\n\\nThe only other thing I'm not a fan of is the seating. We were fortunate enough to get there early and have the back of a booth. The last few people who arrived got the turned around seats in front of us. I feel that the club should invest in long, thin tables like bars have so everyone has a surface to put their food or drinks. \\n\\nOverall, we love the comedians so we'll definitely be back.\",\n",
       " u\"Nice little venue for quality fun.  I saw Greg Warren here last night and had a really good time.  \\n\\nCheck out yippit.com or sign up for Goldstar.com before buying tickets at full price. You can usually find substantial discounts for shows on one of those two sites. Sure there's a two drink minimum but I'm thinking that it helps pay for the comics and helps keep the price of admission down.  When you think about it, it's really a win-win.\",\n",
       " u'Roxy was very funny. Would definitely come back to see her!',\n",
       " u'Positives: They regularly bring in national acts.  I have seen many of my favorite comics here.  Also, you get an opportunity to briefly meet the entertainers on your way out.\\n\\nNegatives: Drink prices are high, and food quality in respect to the price is disproportional.  Entertainer-wise, there is a local comic who opens up for many of the main attractions.  I have seen him open up no less than four times over a span of 3 years, and his act is exactly the same every time.  I have it almost memorized.\\n\\nContinue doing the things you do well, and try to improve the things that almost everyone on Yelp complains about, and you\\'ll be looking at 5 stars from most.  No one wants to come to the Improv to get \"Straint Up\" (see what I did there, Improv?)',\n",
       " u'I love a good night of comedy. But recently i have gone to a couple and they were not all that funny one was a special event too. I would recommend eating at another restaurant prices seem to be a little over priced.',\n",
       " u\"I don't know why, but I just can't like this location very much.  I lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another GE before this one.  Maybe it's the way it's set up or maybe it's the way that the lighting seems so very dim.\\n\\nThe selection is typical for any GE, broad and expansive.  Some prices are a bit steep.  \\n\\nThis location, like many others, has expanded their pharmacy/health care area.  Which is nice, it saves an extra trip to a drug store.\",\n",
       " u\"One of the best grocery stores in the area. Good produce, wide variety of cheeses, good cuts of meat and there's even a six pack shop on the premise.\",\n",
       " u'Years ago I would have given the Big Bird 2 stars. What changed my mind? Competitive pricing. \\nThanks, GE for making it worthwhile to shop your sales. While your no Aldi, you definitely are winning on this front. \\n\\nThis is my goto GE. Always clean, organized and great selection. Added beer a couple years ago and the deli, prepared foods are up to par as well. \\nAlways busy and parking never an issue.',\n",
       " u'This is a review of the Pharmacy. After having them screw up a third time I felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid. The first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of Synthroid, about 1/10th of what I needed. I ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that I was half dead before the problem was caught. Their response when I told them was to say \"oops\" and \"it won\\'t happen again\". Not even a sorry, and it never did happen again b/c I went to Costco after that. This latest time was classic. I came with a simple scrip. Costco was closed so I went to Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can\\'t fill it b/c the scrip isn\\'t specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn\\'t bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn\\'t fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can\\'t even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? I wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all. It seems like they aren\\'t even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs, just random people off of the street. \\n\\nDon\\'t waste your time, or risk your health. Go to any other pharmacy in town, avoid Giant Eagle.',\n",
       " u'I luv store, plenty of cashiers. My father eats there couple times a week. He is a senior citizen and he usually get free coffee because he is a veteran. Last week he was told they no longer doing that program. Today he went to the Edgewood Giant Eagle and they gave him free coffee.',\n",
       " u'This giant eagle is one of the only things I miss about  old house. The produce section and deli were great. Also had an overall nice selection of everything.',\n",
       " u'This is a great supermarket!  All of the staples.  Great deli, market square and bakery.  Fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetables and fruits cut and packaged.  Love the fact that I can shop, drop dry cleaning, and pick up pharmacy items in one stop.  Close to other shopping and wonderful restaurants.',\n",
       " u\"I love books. I love to look at them, hold them, read the cover, thumb through the pages, and then finally I love to dig into a juicy story. When I'm in the area I love coming in here for a latte and book browsing/reading. Most of the time I cave and buy a book.\\n\\nThis store is clean and their employees are helpful and kind. They have two entrances/exits available, a fairly large section for movies & music, study guides, and other organized sections like self-help and history. I personally love the variety of cook books there. One of the attractive points of this store is a cafe. I can come in, sit down, read a magazine or book and just chill. The downside is the chairs aren't super comfortable (to me) and the cafe is usually packed with people. I wish they had more seating options around the store.\\n\\nIt's a convenient location to come in and kill some time like others have mentioned. There's a lot to find in there so come back and browse!\",\n",
       " u'There is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store. \\n\\nThis Barnes and Noble carries on a long history of excellence. They always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking.',\n",
       " u\"It seems every time we go to Waterfront we end up coming here every time. I like the store but it seems rather daunting in that it's so huge.  Pretty much every time we come here if we haven't already hit up the Starbucks in the middle of the walkable part of the Waterfront where many of the retail stores are we'll go to this one which isn't that far away.\\n\\nThere's much more seating at this Starbucks than the one in the middle as well as it just feels less cramped.  The store hasn't changed much, most of the special and clearance stuff is at the front while the alternative entrance at the back is where all the music and movies are.  The store is pretty organized though by type whether it's children's, fiction, magazines, games and toys etc there's pretty much something for everybody.  \\n\\nThe Nook section is pretty much right when you walk in through the main entrance.  I do like this store however I wonder how long it will exist with everything like Amazon and e-Readers changing how people get their material these days.\",\n",
       " u'Went to Barnes and Noble Waterfront with 3 books on my list.       First one there were several books by the same name so they wanted the name of the author.  Went to look it up on my phone.....Barnes and Noble wifi had blocked me.  Wanted me to sign it and allow them access to my information....NOT.  Long story short they only had one of the 3 books I was looking for and it was $4 less on Amazon....Lost this customer.',\n",
       " u'Great atmosphere and rather humble, especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly, even if they are busy. I enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. \\n\\nBe sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!',\n",
       " u\"It's what I expected. Cooler then a Fridays and the food was about the same. It was clean and out waiter was really cool. It was so slow he even took a seat with us and chatted but in a good way and we welcomed him to do so. I had the bar Louie burger for my meal and it was good. Nothing outstanding but again what I expected. My group ordered the avocado fries and meatball appetizers. The avocado fries were good but we had to add salt. The meat balls with the small slices of garlic bread was fun to share and yummy.\\n\\nWe went on a slow Sunday night. It was clean and the food came out on time. Again I rate a places on what I expect it to be and what it try's to be not what I think it should be. So just a different kind of Fridays. Also great music playlist.\",\n",
       " u'My boyfriend and I dined at Bar Louie at the Waterfront about a month ago; it was my first time eating there and I was pretty impressed!\\n\\nWe got loaded nachos as an appetizer and all the toppings were as fresh as they come, not to mention delicious!\\n\\nI ordered pasta (I cannot remember the name) but I asked for no artichokes in it. It turned out the artichokes were pre-mixed in the recipe, but the waitress came and informed us that the chef was whipping up a special batch just for me! I was extremely grateful and impressed.\\n\\nEverything was delicious, the decor was industrial chic (which I love) and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun. The menu was a tad exotic for my small-town pallet, but it was great. My only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself, because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minutes before we found a seat. The food and service certainly made up for it though!',\n",
       " u'Best place for a late dinner. They have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu. Kitchen is open til 2am. The atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant.',\n",
       " u'I went this evening. The chop chop salad was awesome. The shrimp tempora was too bready. The bartenders were awful.',\n",
       " u'Dollar beers on Wednesday Night and Loaded Tater Tots, pretty much two solid reasons to visit.  Matter of fact, they have some sort of special every night of the week wether it be food or drinks or both!\\n\\nLocated across from the movie theater this is a good place to go before or after a flick with your hot date.  I say skip over priced Burgatory and come here on Tuesday for dollar burgers.  Just as good and half the bill.',\n",
       " u'Food was 7 out of 10 for this type of bar / restaurant. Service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor. Untrained and understaffed bartenders will keep me from coming back. No reason to not be able to get a drink when sitting at the bar.',\n",
       " u\"Good drink (new old fashioned)Food was so so (shrimp tempura app), but service was NOT good and I think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen. Food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer - approx. 20 mins. with zero acknowledgment from my bartender.  Shrimp were cooked well, but sauces were extremely salty & sweet to be paired with tempura batter.  The bar is drafty and customers other than me were complaining with no noticeable change. I'm not staying for a main course\",\n",
       " u\"I wanna love Bar Louie, I do. It seems like even on the deadest of nights it takes 20 minutes or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from us. The food is good, but the past 3 or 4 times I've come they've been out of tater tots by 9 PM, and I'm always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides it's now time to tell the wait staff they're out of something. It may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the Waterfront.\",\n",
       " u\"Well it's 9pm on a Tuesday and no tater tots. Dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature. Not very happy. Will try the station square bar Louie next time.\",\n",
       " u\"I absolutely love the ambiance of this place. The bar area is very large, and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot. A solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back! It doesn't generally get very crowded (even on Friday and Saturday nights), so don't expect a South Side type of environment. \\n\\nAll that being said, there is a reason why this is a two-star review. Even though this place doesn't get crowded, it takes a very long time to get served. I have waited up to 30 minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty bar.\",\n",
       " u\"I only go here when I can't get into Burgatory and because I enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere.  Their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good, but their healthier food options are really lacking.  I tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality.  The tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle.  They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it's the last week in April now). I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as it's probably been in there for 6 months now, so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good.  The service is ok but rather slow.  Overall I'm pretty underwhelmed by this place.\",\n",
       " u\"My friends and I went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner. Everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into Bar Louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table. He immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks. Only another 30 minutes until he brought ONE martini over. We ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up. We tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out! He didn't get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there. Very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part. We weren't the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset. I hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second day.\",\n",
       " u'Sign stated \"Seat Yourself\" so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in.  We originally sat upstairs, which was open per the sign.  After 20 minutes we got up and went outside. After 20 minutes outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to us, we said screw it and walked.  The one other time that I had been there the service was so-so.  I will never go back.  Why should I have to try to track people down to pay for a meal?!?',\n",
       " u'Should have checked the reviews before we went. I\\'ve been to \"real\" Bar Louie\\'s in other cities. This is not one of them. Was seated for 20 min and no wait staff came to take our order. Several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on. Awkward. Then someone came over with two plates of food trying to serve us. We thought, here was our big chance to get served, but no, she just walked away. So we left. There are so many restaurants where you can get burgers, just go someplace else.',\n",
       " u'Was there for Saturday dinner at 6pm and still had some seats opened.  We sat down right away.  You sat yourself and menu was at the table.   Very casual place, yet family place.   A little noisy so not for date nights.  A little bit sports bar like but not like Champs.  Food was great.  Had boneless chicken nuggets (el fuego).  Side salad was very good.  I had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewers with shrimp fried rice - I had some and it was delicious.  Clean bathroom- very important.',\n",
       " u'Great place for late dinner after work. Kitchen stays open late. Real good food. Full bar and real good service. Great location.',\n",
       " u\"Came here for happy hour and a bite to eat on a Friday evening.  They have some great happy hour deals - $3 drafts (with a nice selection) and half off flat bread pizza. I believe there are three or four different types of the flat bread to choose from.  \\n\\nMy friend and I sat at the bar and I have to say the service was just ok.  We weren't given plates or silverware with our pizza, the servers didn't seem to know what the other was doing, and it was a bit haphazard.  I ordered a burger medium rare that came out so rare I could have milked the cow.  However, the tatertots served with it were delicious.\\n\\nLocated at the Waterfront across from the movie theater Bar Louie offers both indoor and outdoor seating and is a decent option if you don't want to wait around at the other restaurants (Burgatory is directly across from it!).  \\n\\nThis will not be a go to destination for me but it is a decent happy hour choice.\",\n",
       " u\"I've had a pretty wide variety of experiences at Bar Louie.  Sometimes I go and the service is decent and the drinks are good, and sometimes I go and the service is really slow and the drinks are flat or just plain bad.  The one thing that is usually pretty consistent though is the food.  Any food that I have ordered has always been pretty good.  I've never had an amazing experience here, but I do still go back for food and drink specials and because of its location near the movie theater.\",\n",
       " u\"I love Bar Louie's happy hour. $5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread? Sign me up!  They also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour, but the flatbread is the one I usually get. \\n\\nThe melon martini is my current favorite, but most that I've tried have been good.\\n\\nI don't recommend the shrimp appetizer. And I'm not sure about some of the other food, but happy hour is 5/5 stars. The rest of the time, Bar Louie is probably a 3 star place. \\n\\nSo, if you're in the waterfront and are thinking of Bar Louie, go for the happy hour!\",\n",
       " u'Worst bar I have ever been to. They used maybe no alchohol in their drinks and consistency had no meaning here. We ordered three berry mojitos and they were different significantly. I posted a picture, you judge.',\n",
       " u'I went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night.  We got to Bar Louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started, which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done.  We had a table right away and the server took drink orders, but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  She then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order.  The food took almost an hour, and we had only ordered a couple appetizers.  The portions were really small for the price, and most of the food came out burnt.  I did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food.  Again, waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have.  \\n\\nThe place was busy, but not overcrowded, what I would expect on a typical weeknight.  There is no excuse for the poor service and food.  On top of that, the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently.  Maybe it was just an off night for this place, but I do not plan on going back again and taking that chance.',\n",
       " u'The worst bar and the worst service in the area. If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is not one positive thing I could say about any times Ive ever been here. It has now been added to my very short list of places I will never step foot in again. Please... Take your hard earned money elsewhere.',\n",
       " u\"My boyfriend and I came for $1 burger night and the food was delicious! I am not a huge bread fan; I usually eat my sandwiches open faced but I loved the buns. My boyfriend ordered a $1chicken and a $1burger  and got both chicken. That wouldn't be a big deal if the service made up for mistakes. We love the atmosphere and taste of food but the service is horrible. This review is not based on a one night experience. Out of three different times we have experienced bad service- very inattentive. Managers need to review the importance of service with their staff.  If some one likes you and you are attentive to their needs, they are less likely to complain! Bit when you are ignored and they make mistakes, most make it a point to bring it to a managers attention!\",\n",
       " u'The place where my fianc\\xe9 and I first met. Went back for anniversary, mentioned it to server, and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate. Very, very cool Bar Louie! Love ya even more now! \\n\\nJerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away - extremely spicy - very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat. \\nBuffalo chicken flat bread - great but hot too',\n",
       " u\"We went to the Sandcastle Waterpark this past weekend before we went to Heinz Field.  We are a family of four; Dad, Mom, 17 year old girl, and 8 year old girl.  We all enjoyed it.  There was plenty to do for everyone; wave pool, kiddie pools, single tube slides, double tube slides, and body slides.  It was a cloudy day in the upper 70's, so it wasn't crowded at all.  Check for coupons at Giant, Local Flavor, and other places.  Some things don't open until 12 PM, even when the park opens at 11 AM.  Parking is $6.00.\",\n",
       " u\"I have the season pass and go atleast once a week and each time I've been in the last week Ive been.disappointed. Two weeks ago they threw a rubber baby in the wave pool and entice panic and claimed iy was a training exercise. Disgusted. And today twice the pool with mushroom and waterfall in it was shut down due to adults pooping in the pool or puking dont know cant get a strait answer from any of employees. Just sad there customer service sucks.\",\n",
       " u\"This was my first time back in about 12 years.  I haven't been here since high school so its hard for me to compare 12 years ago to now.  I do know the prices have gone up but i can remember paying $19.  I think the best thing you can do is purchase the tickets at giant eagle or even looking on the sandcastle website for deals.  My sister for a deal for 19.99 and day in the 2015 season.  I  paid 26.99 at my local giant eagle.  Thats not really a big deal.  \\n\\nI am definetly shocked that there was a $6 or $12 fee to park.. I mean its ridiculous we have to pay what we pay to get in and another fee to park is crazy.  We opted for the $12 fee to park real close to the entrance bc of having a 7 year old with us.  It is worth that extra $6.  \\n\\nI learned that you should get there and line up at the game fairly early if you want a good spot by the pool... People with plow you over and run to get a prime spot.  That is a downfall.  Plus this means that there are a lot of RUDE PEOPLE.  We got there early enough to ride all the rides we needed too.  we didn't do the lay river however because the lines were RIDICULOUS.  \\n\\nThe wave pool was a hit for my son but just watch all the people there.  People are rude there as well.  Some horse play and such. \\n\\nI must comment on the food, i def love potato patch fries but the prices are crazy... I ordered 2 chicken tender meals with fries and the costed me around 35 with drinks.  THATS is BS.  \\n\\nSandcastle is an ok place to visit, but its just not worth the money\",\n",
       " u'Insanely expensive! $6 parking. $8 locker. $9 wrinkled, burnt hot dog. I really hate this place. Kids received season passes for Christmas present. Brought kids once and will never return. Spent $46 on food and threw most of it away',\n",
       " u'Excellent service! The driver was first class! Truly was the best car service I have ever experienced. Driver was classy, professional and kind. Great reservation service and very fair price. Do yourself a favor-skip the cab and call this car service. Reliable, professional and great value. Thank you!',\n",
       " u'Fried rice super bland.\\nChicken was slimy.\\nService was indifferent. \\nNo repeat visit for me.',\n",
       " u\"I'm not sure what it is about this place that I love so much. I have been eating here for probably 10 years now, and it NEVER disappoints. Its not fancy, its not unique, its not some fantastic restaurant, its a chinese takeout place. But it is delicious! Everything I have ever ordered is good. The general tsos, the chicken with broccoli, the beef with broccoli, the sweet n sour, the teriyaki, etc. etc. But the real treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup. Their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself. It is also always ready in 10-15 minutes.\\n\\nAffordable, fast, and delicious.\",\n",
       " u'Came here the other day for a late lunch with a friend. The place was pretty dead and we were seated right away. Took 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and we just order both drinks and food then. Took another 30 minutes to just get our drinks (2 beers on draft) and tables who were seated after us were served much faster then us. Finally our food came (soup, salad, boneless wings, and fries). A different server delivered the food and it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. After being given our food we were completely ignored, along with others in our section. Us and two other tables waited over 45 minutes just to try and ask for our check (one table just got up and left!) \\n\\nBeing a server myself, I try to be very understanding to the wait staff. But this was ridiculous, the restaurant was not even close to busy and my section of about 5-6 tables was ignored.',\n",
       " u'A T.G.I. Friday\\'s is a T.G.I. Friday\\'s. You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there\\'s nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday\\'s, it\\'s not particularly easy to eat here if you\\'re anything other than a meat lover).\\n\\nHonestly I wasn\\'t expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday\\'s website that it\\'s ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday\\'s after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday\\'s only had a 15 minute wait.\\n\\nOnce we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday\\'s. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I\\'d ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.\\n\\nThis T.G.I.Friday\\'s really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it\\'s not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It\\'s just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I\\'d consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn\\'t be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy.',\n",
       " u'I understand its a chain, and pretty standardized everywhere you go, but I found this location to be especially bad. First, when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant, nothing visibly dirty, but smells like the entire joint needs de-greased. Second, the service, the host was a typical younger girl, efficient without too much professionalism, not a big deal. The waitress, a \"professional\" , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  Our food took a long time, and she \\'saved\\' herself by telling us that she didn\\'t know why our food wasn\\'t ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with luke-warm food came out soon after. She reeked of cigarette smoke, so i\\'m going to make a dumb assumption and guess that\\'s where she was.  The food, typical TGI-fridays food, good enough, for a chain restaurant.  Extremely unlikely that i\\'d return.',\n",
       " u'Fridays seems to have gone down hill. I was quite surprised when we went and there want a wait. I thought we had lucked out. We were seated quickly and our server came over quickly. There was only one other table that had people in the section we were in. \\nI ordered a Jack Daniels burger-cooked medium. Our food came quickly. My burger was well done and dry. Without the Jack Daniels sauce there was no flavor at all.  The fries were pretty good.\\nI was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone.  Thankfully our server did a nice job.',\n",
       " u'Service was very slow from the beginning.. It took a while for us to get our water. I ordered a blue raspberry slushie which also took awhile to be served. It tasted okay.. But the mango peach slushie was way better! You can change flavours! \\n\\nWe got the all you can eat appetizers for $10 but now you can only get refills on the same appetizer you ordered. Whereas in the past, you could change the appetizers you ordered.\\n\\nSo we got loaded potato skins which was delicious. The skin was crispy and the potato was soft and the cheese was so good! The bacon bits were crispy! \\n\\nWe trie jack Daniels and barbecue boneless wings. The jack Daniels were my favourite. They were sweet and crispy! \\n\\nThe potstickers were very hot when they were first served and after awhile, the skin of the potsticker was just really floury and chewy.',\n",
       " u'I would write anthems, poems, novels about their pizza. \\n\\nI\\'ve dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish. \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  \"No not personal...Regular.\" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing. \\n\\nIt came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. And then another - ooh that sausage...\\nUntil there was nothing left. \\n\\nI had achieved my dream. But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious. \\n\\nBut the fries were mediocre.',\n",
       " u\"How does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront!  \\n\\nI won't lie, I do like their Lobster Bisque but every time I've gone it's just over priced, average quality with semi ok service.\\n\\nSkip this place all together and get pizza at Pizza Company and take it home.\",\n",
       " u'I am glad that Western Pennsylvania has one remaining outlet for the great Chicago-style deep dish pizza offered by Uno, its pioneer.  Dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal I enjoyed in Chicago last month at Uno subsidiary, Pizzeria Due.\\n\\nThe restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the outdoor seating by the river a delight.  The tables outside, though, are too close and if all are occupied, one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables.\\n\\nThe spinach and chicken pizza, appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious, but the zucchini was extremely salty.\\n\\nOur server was pleasant and attentive, performing many quality checks.  $20.99 is a lot to pay for a pizza, but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people. $7.75 for a small glass of house wine is excessive.  The $4.99 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes.\\n\\nThe weak link was the young lady who seated us.  She was glum, unfriendly, and without a smile.  Instead of saying \"Enjoy your meal\" when seating customers, she says, \"There you are.\"  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation. At The Cheesecake Factory, the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table. The individual at Uno got us off to a poor start.  A nice touch would be for a manager to provide a quality check and make the diner feel welcome.',\n",

       " u'Possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is.  Nearly $20 for a pepperoni pizza for two would be okay if it were good.   Crust is extremely dry and unflavorful.\\n\\nIf you want a good deep dish pizza, try Burghs Pizza and Wing pub in Bridgeville.   Their deep dish is thicker, tastier crust, better sauce, and a lot more cheese/toppings.   Cheaper too.\\n\\nService was just barely adequate on this visit.',\n",
       " u\"Nice place to grab a bite and a beer. Service is quick, friendly and accurate. They've got a respectable selection of craft beers and the atmosphere is very clean and comfortable. Good view of the TV from any angle in the bar area (watching a Bucco's game at the moment) and the bar itself is full service. The Baked Stuffed Spinoccoli chicken that I had was delicious. I have no idea why I don't come here more often... I should!\",\n",
       " u\"This was my first time at an uno's in about ten years. My kids ordered pizza which was just ok.

       " u\"The only reason to come here is because it's a fun place to eat. It sure isn't the food. \\n\\nToo much dressing in a salad that didn't even fill the bowl. Like so many before it, UNOs is making me leave hungry. It was a salad with Walnuts, Goat Cheese, and Blueberries, and while it was good, there was absolutely no value in this meal. One of these days I will learn to stop eating at big chain restaurants, kind of like not shopping at big box stores. \\n\\nIt's a nice atmosphere and generally crowded and loud. Some would call it fun and I think it is. But, sometimes it's worth a little extra to get what you really want and need in a meal. That's what adds value. \\n\\nIn the future these places will be relegated to the last ditch effort when nothing else is available. Only in a pinch.\",\n",

       " u\"Met my family here after work on a weekday. Not many people dining here at the time but our dinners seemed to take longer then they should have considering not very busy. As we were waiting on our pizza the waitress handed us a trivia game console to use. We played 2 games of trivia and the game of life. The pizza came and the crust was very dry and not much flavor to it. When we were presented with our check we noticed a charge of $1.99 that we didn't know what it was for.  When we asked what the charge was for they charged us for the games that we played on the console that they gave us while waiting for our dinner. I have never heard of anything like it. I wonder how many people used the games and were charged the fee and paid it without noticing it on the bill considering it was hidden discreetly in the middle of the bill. Then when we were ready to pay the bill with cash. We couldn't get our server to come and take payment. Was very disappointed. It will probably be awhile before I go back if ever.\",\n",

The deep dish personal pepperoni pizza wasn't very good -- the sauce tasted bland, the crust tasted oily and a bit overcooked or stale, and there wasn't much flavor to the cheese. I haven't been feeling well and thought it might just be me, but my husband tried it and said the same thing. He also said his chicken parmesan sauce tasted bland.\\n\\nI feel bad -- it was a little like looking at an old Taylor Swift album you used to love five years ago, except now you realize the songs were sappy and she looked completely different. I used to love Uno, but it's not at all what I remembered it to be.\",\n",

I get them in the USPS, but why ask for email address then?\\n\\nUpdate*** I asked about the email coupons to the sales associate.

I love that they are really trying to help finding the right clothes for you instead of telling you \"how beautiful everything looks on you\". I always feel welcomed and I really do appreciate the fact that I am not being approached by a staff member every two minutes (this unfortunately happens in a lot of other stores in this area). This store feels more personal. Combine that with quality and affordable clothes and happy staff members and you definitely have a new regular customer!',\n",

They raised their prices, changed the menu, and removed several of our favorite dishes from the menu. The veggie dumplings are gone, the jasmine iced tea is gone, and the mini-dessert are gone. The food is meh. My broccoli was mushy in the ginger chicken and the sauce was like candy because it was too sweet.\",\n",
       " u'First of all, I LOVE pfchangs, but I  recently visited here and had really bad experience. The waitress hardly paid any attention to us. The hostess had to like help her. I even wanted to order a to-go...but I couldn\\'t find her, so I just went up to the bar and ordered it.  I\\'m a server myself, so maybe I had high expectations. ..but I still tipped her like 12 on 30. I still love it though.

We waited almost 15 minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table. The waiter forget several things we asked for and above all, the food was tasteless and the portion sizes smaller than lunch sized portions. We were there before the dinner crowd started so the lack of service or food quality can't be blamed on a busy time. Don't think we will be going back there.\",\n",

I am a very very picky eater.  I don't like onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, rice, etc.  Aaron was awesome in his help as I selected my food.   \\n\\nVery rarely do  I eat dessert.  I love their  pineapple coconut ice cream.  There banana sprung rolls are good, but the ice cream is to die for.  The two come together.\",\n",

But he smiled, brought me a clean cup, and I wiped the sugar container clean. (pet pev) \\n\\nOtherwise everything else was ok? Some times it's the service. \\n\\nA bad server ruins everything.

       " u\"I was a little peeved that the gluten free version of the Buddha Feast cost $10.50 when the regular version cost $9.50. So you're charging a dollar more to give me the gluten-free version of a veggie, tofu, and rice platter?? Regardless, it's worth it to get the gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy for myself and I know isn't THAT expensive). When my dish comes out, it's literally just steamed veggies and rice. No tofu, no seasoning or sauce. I ask why there's no tofu and the response is that the tofu has gluten in it. When I ask if there should be any sauce (aka flavor) to the dish I'm informed I could've ordered any other gluten-free dish's sauce to go along with it. Thanks for the info now...yes I'll take the GF beef broccoli sauce on the side. The sauce comes out and it's actually tasty so my food was finally interesting enough to eat, even though now I'm extra annoyed at paying $10.50 for steamed veggies and rice and why the menu made no mention that you wouldn't get flavor or tofu. \\nTo top it all off based on how miserable I feel now, I'm pretty sure the beef broccoli sauce they brought out contained gluten anyway! So I paid more, got less, and still got gluten in my food!?!? \\nNot a happy customer. Not going back. Not going to recommend it to anyone.\",\n",
       " u\"Disappointing :( I expected more out of PF Chang's. All I can say is that there is better Chinese at a non chain place, and it is cheaper. Wouldn't go back. I you want Chinese go to How Lee, or China Palace.\",\n",

Got seated not far from the hostess station and sat for close to 15 mins without anyone coming to the table, no water, nothing. The table next to us who got seated after us had a server and water by the time we left. Got up to leave and the hostess said \"is everything OK\" I said \"no, no one ever came over\"and we went to Bravo and had a great lunch! I like PF Chang\\'s in general but if the 2 hostesses watched us sit there for 15 mins I have no idea why they didn\\'t do something. I won\\'t be going back here anytime soon.',\n",

I'm aware that it's not authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious.\\n\\nWe stopped by after some shopping in the area on a snowy Friday, and were able to get a table pretty quickly.  The hostess and server were both friendly.  My husband enjoyed a glass of sake, and I had a mai tai that turned out to be delicious.  We split an order of lettuce wraps as an appetizer; they don't custom-make your sauce any more which is disappointing, but they did happily provide us with chili paste and hot mustard to doctor it up ourselves.  His Chang's Spicy Chicken (extra spicy) turned out great, and provided the extra requested heat.  My Orange Peel Shrimp were as good as I'd remembered-- perhaps better because they have some fresh orange slices included as well.  We also ordered a Great Wall of  Chocolate.  If you like  chocolate cake at all, you'll love this one.\\n\\nPF Chang's consistently provides good Chinese in a trendy (but still casual) atmosphere at a decent price, and I'm always a fan.\",\n",
       " u\"This is largely a review for Sean, a managing partner at this location. I had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape before getting inundated with guests. A few of us ordered the lunch special with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), but the service was a bit of a disaster- dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer with a big family meal; a few dishes came out dirty; soups didn't come out at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great care of us and went way, way out of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank Sean enough for making sure we left in a good mood after what could have been a very negative experience. Heaven knows that a positive tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family!\",\n",
       " u\"Since I have foot problems and am limited as to the type of shoes I can wear I generally come here. Normally both of your feet are measured for accuracy.  Most styles come in European sizes so I am familiar with the size I normally wear.\\n\\nThey also sell orthotics which you can put in sneakers or special orthodics for dress shoes. If you have a foot problem they will give give you 10% off your purchase of the orthotic once your mention your doctor's name.\\n\\nI normally come here for sneakers, sandals and on rare occasion a dress shoe. They offer a reward program for the amount of your purchase once you reach a certain threshhold.\\n\\nI have never had a problem with any of my orthotics and give them a high recommendation. They do offer trunk shows which was the reason for my recent visit since I needed a pair of summer sandals and a waterproof sneaker for an upcoming trip. Normally they sell New Balance for sneakers and their prices are relatively comparable to that which you would find in other shoe stores.\\n\\nHowever, the do carry some better lines so expect to pay a little more if you want the quality of a name brand shoe. You are permitted to purchase the items and try it around the house to see if you are comfortable with it. If unhappy then you have two weeks to return it at which point it becomes a final sale.\\n\\nTime will normally tell if I had made the right purchase or not. I bought a pair of waterproof sneakers and an Allegra sandal which is versatile. They were kind enough to stretch the sneaker to make sure it wasn't bothering my bunion.\\n\\nLocated at the Waterfront parking can be a bit difficult but there is usually ample parking in the back of the complex.\",\n",
       " u\"My daughter and I went to Panera Waterfront, Homestead Pa. around 4 pm on a Saturday and TRIED to order a dozed bagels.  We inquired as to when more Asiago bagels would be available and the counter person responded with we won't be making more bagels  that's all we have.  Thinking maybe this was a mistake I tried calling in for a dozen bagels at 3 pm on Saturday a couple weeks later and was told the same thing that Panera ' a neighborhood bakery' was OUT of French Toast bagels at 3 pm and won't be making any more.  I find it interesting they have many employees standing around I could see if they were busy but they aren't busy and items are in the oven baking and with several hours left open for business they easily deny customers product they want to purchase surely it doesn't take very long to bake 6 bagels when given a couple hours.  Maybe they should not be so concerned about the leftovers being donated instead they should focus on customers reasonable request.\",\n",
       " u\"In general, I like Panera so rather than reviewing Panerai overall, I'm going to compare this Panera store to other Panera stores that I've been to.\\n\\nI've been here a couple times and so far, no major complaints in terms of food and service. The people are generally friendly (honestly, they are probably the friendliest Panera staff I've seen in all of the Panera stores I've been to in Pittsburgh, although I haven't been to them all). Once, I came in after breakfast time and asked for a quiche and they gave it to me without any problems. I haven't had to wait super long, even if there are a lot of people. \\n\\nHowever, my biggest problem with this Panera store is that there are hardly any outlets and seating is rather a pain. I like to go to Panera to eat and do work at the same time but it's rather hard when there aren't many seats and very few outlets.\\n\\nFood: 4 stars - just your average Panera food\\nService: 5 stars - as mentioned, pretty good experience\\nSeating: 1 star - don't come here to work or come with a huge party\\nOverall: 3 stars\",\n",

If I am meeting someone I prefer to sit in a booth for more privacy. I like the homey feel of Panera and love it when I get to sit by the fireplace. \\nThe bakery items are always fresh. It's nice that they keep the chocolate chip cookies warm. Yum!\\nThe food is unpredictable. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not so good. The serving sizes on their soups and salads have shrunk considerably in the last year. They do have a good selection of food. They keep adding healthier options. Their recent addition is Soba Noodle Bowls. They look good but I sense a lot of sodium hides in them. \\nIf you need a place to meet someone to chat or get some work done it is a good place. Food wise there are many other choices to consider around the city for better food at the same prices.\",\n",
       " u'Panera is one of our family\\'s favorite restaurants. Everything is great. Kids love bagels and chicken noodle soup. Adults usually order \"you pick two\". Sandwiches, salad are all very good.',\n",
       " u'This Panera Bread location is ideally located in the Waterfront shopping center in the midst of several shops and a large parking lot. The space itself is much larger than many other locations I have been to and has ample seating, which is always a good thing. Unfortunately, the service is slow and unfriendly (there was no line and it took a few moments for someone to notice there were customers trying to order). I was surprised that I was automatically given a baguette with my meal rather than being offered a choice between the bread, an apple or a bag of chips. Perhaps it is this location, or maybe it was just a one-off oversight. As I mentioned, there is plenty of seating, but our options were limited because all of the tables were disgusting with trash on them and in desperate need of a wipe-down. If it were over lunch or a rush, I would be more sympathetic, but there were only a handful of patrons in the entire establishment. I was also upset that the WiFi was not functioning. Despite my nitpicking, the food was fine and it is a standard Panera, just not a stellar location.',\n",
       " u\"It has been several months since I visited Panera Bread. It is a bakery cafe chain with free WiFi. Prices are reality the same although from time to time they change their seasonal offerings.\\n\\nFood is fair. You order and you are given a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. They use real dishes and silverware. The menu gives you a calorie count of each item you are purchasing.  One of the popular feature items is you pick two where you can have half a sandwich or salad or soup in a pair of two of those items. You also get with it a choice of an apple or roll and you can add a dessert for $1.00\\n\\nI was disappointed to learn they had removed the French onion soup from the menu. I asked about this removal only to learn there was something wrong with one of the ingredients. The other disappointment was that this year they are not making gingerbread men which are one of my favorite holiday treats. Instead they are offering a holiday themed sugar cookie.\\n\\nI normally eat here when I'm in a hurry and don't have time to sit down at a regular restaurant. They do use fresh breads and they do cater. You can also order your holiday baked goods or breads for your parties.\",\n",
       " u'Stopped by Sunday morning. The light roast coffee was cold. I ordered a Steak & Egg breakfast sandwich. The Steak was ice cold. The slice of tomato that I had them add was not ripe.

I still need to come look at them because it's Target. Addicting.\\n\\nThis one is closer to my house and it's a relatively nice size. I wouldn't rave about customer service because it's very, very basic or sometimes doesn't exist. On my last visit I had a young lady ringing me up and talking to her friend on the side at the same time. She couldn't scan some soap so she asked me what the price was and I couldn't remember (but I knew it was on sale for two-something dollars). Instead of checking it out, I watched her enter $3.99 as she continued to speak with her friend. I found some other mistakes as well. When I'm out on the floor browsing, I rarely ever get anyone asking if I need any help (if any associates happen to be nearby). 99% of the time I don't actually need help, but it's the thought that counts I guess.\\n\\nI don't usually grocery shop at Target, but if I do need something then this one is fine for me. It's a good location, parking is easy, carts are always available (with wipes to sanitize!), there's a starbucks in there (umm hello addiction #1), and you can find some good deals. I like how they have easy to find/browse clearance sections at the end of aisles. If you have their target card then some of the sales give you gift cards for a purchase and you get 5% off all your purchases with that card. I still love you Target. Always.\",\n",

Since the rise of AMAZON I find it kind of pointless to visit any more.  They do have good prices of CD's and sometimes a hell of a deal on games, but nothing you couldn't find looking hard on EBay.\\n\\nSave your gas if your not close but if you need something quick, I don't see why you shouldn't use Target as your option.\",\n",
       " u\"The Waterfront as a whole is a pretty busy shopping area and this particular Target is no different.  With a bunch of big box stores and restaurants at this side of the mall it can get pretty busy here.  \\n\\nThis Target however to me seems like one of the more disorganized ones compared to the many others I've been to.  Clothing displays are very mixed up that is many things are on racks mixed up with other things.  I found a wall hanging I liked but it was hard to go through them where the diagonal racks storing them were.  Some of the toys seem to be like that too.  It's not as easy to find things here as other places.  Things are or end up being where they just don't seem to belong for one reason or another.\\n\\nThe one saving grace of most of the Target stores including this one is the check out lines are very fast and efficient.  That and the aisles are large enough to negotiate around because they seem wide enough that you don't feel so tight like at Walmart.\",\n",
       " u\"Target and I go way back like the driver's seat in my brother's car. Despite my murky history with Target, I prefer it way more over Walmart, which is closer to home. Just overall quality, atmosphere, and clientele is way better. \\n\\nWe needed a large number of photos printed and my father had decided to go to FedEx. I can only imagine this decision because they're known for print quality. They should also be known for being cumbersome and overcharging. After an hour of struggling with their machines to print, we left. I suggested Target because we were in the area, and I halfway remembered that they used the Kodak app to develop pictures from your phone. \\n\\nAs soon as we get in, it's always a win because pictures are 25\\xa2, compared to 49\\xa2 at their competitor. It was easy to sync up the photo library via wifi to the kiosk with the app. After choosing and modifying all of our pictures, we were given a slip stating our order of 63 pictures would be ready in 15 minutes. \\n\\nWe picked up everything else we needed and checked out, finishing in 7 minutes. By then our photos were done and we checked out at the photo stand, paying less than half of what we anticipated paying at the other place. Plus the quality was fantastic, the photos weren't too glossy, and everything worked out perfectly. \\n\\nWill we be back? Absolutely!\",\n",
       " u\"I find this target to be average.. although im here quite a bit. I guess im just used to where everything is at the east liberty location.. i always feel so lost here. It's decent though. the checkout lines move quickly\",\n",
       " u\"We rented tuxedos for a wedding had to go down twice for fittings they we still wrong everyone's tuxedos were to big the pants were falling off everyone. The staff was not helpful in any way the walk away from you and don't come back. The worst tux I've ever rented you think if u pay $180 for a tux\\nIt should fit you take my advise if your going to rent a tux don't go to the men's warehouse in the water front.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is bohunk central. Tuxedo jacket fit great. White slim fit shirt looked ridiculous. It was so big that I literally could jump off a skyscraper and land safely. \\n\\nMy friend got sized and this new guy (super nice) measured his 33 inch waist at 38. He looked really terrible at the wedding and was super depressed about it. His jacket didn't fit and his white shirt was worse than mine. I\\n\\nThe staff was really nice though. It's not their problem that men's warehouse picks vendors that support a 350 pound male frame. \\n\\nI hope I never rent a tuxedo from Men's Warehouse again.\",\n",
       " u'Let me start out by saying that my husband loves the MW at Westmoreland Mall, and even rented his tux there for our wedding without issue. Last year, he also rented a tux there for an out-of-town wedding he was in. After the wedding was over (the next day, before we returned home), we returned the tux to a MW at the local mall, also sans any issues.\\n\\nRecently, said husband got a promotion and bought some dress pants and shirts from MW at the mall, and was sent a $50 gift card. Last weekend, we decided to head down to The Waterfront....lo and behold, there\\'s a MW in Homestead. Who knew? So, we head to MW to see if he can get something for free. Before we go in, I ask him, how much are pants normally at MW? He said, oh about $50 or $60. Okay, well the cheapest pair of pants we find are around $130, but most around $200?! I\\'m shocked, never thought men\\'s dress clothes were so pricey. Again, who knew? Surprisingly, we were able to sift through the sale racks and were able to find one pair of pants on sale for $19.99 and dress shirts for $14.99! Very exciting! \\n\\nThe problem was the staff and the store itself. First of all, the store was messy. Sales racks had clothes out of place and shirts rolled up, not a good impression for a \\'high end\\' men\\'s clothing store, not to mention it was hard to look for sizes etc. with everything out of place.\\n\\nThe biggest issue was with the staff. There were five employees in the store. Okay, I get it, they work on commission, but seriously. The one and only employee who approached us, and I can\\'t remember her name but she was a middle-aged Russian woman- was a shark! She asked if we need help, we both say no, we\\'re fine. Just looking. I am much more assertive than my husband, however, which she realized right away. Needless to say, she wouldn\\'t leave us alone. I tried several times - nicely - to tell her we were just looking around. My husband said, I\\'m looking for some dress shirts and pants. maybe a tie. She just doesn\\'t get it...keeps asking \"Do you want to look at more ties?\" \"We have nice blazers and jackets\" I\\'m finally like, lady we\\'re only here because we have a gift card, we don\\'t plan on spending a ton of money. Getting her to leave us alone was near impossible. If it would have been me alone, I would have walked out. However, I knew my husband wanted to use the gift card.\\n\\nThe worst part is there were other customers in the store that no one was waiting on. Some of which were looking around for assistance. I didn\\'t get it.\\n\\nContinuing on, check out was a nightmare! Each and every item rang up more than the price tag. She had to end up cancelling the sale and re-doing the whole thing. We had to carefully scrutinize every thing she rang up, to make sure we weren\\'t overcharged. We ended up going over the $50 - obviously. So, she says, \"You can swipe your card there.\" I said, \"We have cash\" and omg you would have thought it was the end of the world. They had no money in the drawer and she actually had to send another employee in the back to get us change. \\n\\nLet\\'s just say, I\\'m sure my hub won\\'t returning here anytime soon. You can buy nice men\\'s clothing almost anywhere else for less money and less hassle. \\n\\nPros: None',\n",
       " u\"After numerous visits to The Men's Wearhouse throughout the years, I would give this place a thumb's up. The service is always excellent. The products are comfortable. And if items do not fit, they can be altered for a fee. In the long run, the alterations make for a perfect fit.\",\n",
       " u'I just had a white pizza with added spinach. It was delicious! I love the thicker crust that was crunchy and chewy at the same time.\\nI also got a greek salad, and you can tell the dressing was homemade cause it was perfect.',\n",
       " u'When I go to other pizza places I ask myself \"will this be as good as Pizza Companies pizza\"?.  \\n\\nI don\\'t understand how this place hasn\\'t gotten Papa Johns big cause rarely do I get a pizza or a sandwich that\\'s inconsistent with the last one I got.  The Steak Untouchables though not Primantis, is the close runner up for my favorite \"sandwich with everything on it\".  The hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce.  I hate when you go somewhere and it\\'s just regular ripped off the head lettuce, not this place.  I do think it\\'s a little expensive but I\\'ve watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so I\\'m sure it\\'s justified.  \\n\\nSide tip, go in and get a slice of Pizza, it\\'s a little different than their whole pizzas you order.  It\\'s really good.\\n\\nOh yeah, be sure to ask for Longfellow Bones, he\\'s a cook there and a hell of a rapper.  Tell him HITTofMCM sent you.',\n",
       " u\"The pizza is definitely good. The wings aren't crisp and they don't provide a dipping sauce for the wings.\",\n",
       " u\"I love BBB; however, this location is terrible. It is RARE that I find an employee that actually helps you voluntarily. I feel that everyone hates their jobs, especially the manager, Davina. I work at a more upscale retail store and I feel it is my responsibility to genuinely welcome, smile, greet, and service our clients. Maybe I'm reaching too high with BBB. I feel they expect YOU to greet THEM and make THEM feel comfortable. I never could understand this mentality. Maybe they should pay ME for this responsibility.\",\n",
       " u\"Coffee!! \\n\\nI have a Keurig Vue and this is the only store I've been able to find that carries Vue cups. The only other place I can find them is online and I'm not a morning person. So waiting a week for shipping is just not an option sometimes. Aside from that I feel like all they jam pack the store full of everything they can.  Not that that's a bad thing but it does make it hard to find what your looking for sometimes.\",\n",
       " u\"Poor service from the door.  I walked in and was ignored.  When I walked in they were more worried about the lack of pies in the case than they were in seating customers.  In fact the person that entered after me was attended to before I was even acknowledged.  I mean, I'm no skinny person by a long shot, but if I'm standing in front of the hostess podium, I expect to be noticed at least.  \\n\\nWhen I was finally seated things went a little smoother.  That might be because I opted for the salad bar and didn't have to have anyone bring me the items from there.  \\n\\nI really expected better from this location, especially since it is basically next door to the home office.  There was no line or mad rush to get in here, I just baffled.\",\n",
       " u\"What I love about ENP (aside from the Smiley Face cookies) is they have different things on the menu you don't find at Bob Evans and Cracker Barrel like vitamin water, Eggs Benedict, omelettes, buffet, healthier options.  Service was great.\",\n",
       " u\"Eat n Park is the place for smiles, but mine is kind of that emoji that has a squiggly line. \\nThins I like about EnP:\\n1. You always know what you're getting. Standard across the board. \\n2.Pies great. Baked goods great. \\n3. Soup good. \\n4. Who doesn't love a Smiley cookie? \\n5. They are a charitable group and I think that's awesome. \\n\\nThings that make me squiggly smile. I ordered the basic breakfast smile the other day. I asked to hold the toast and potatoes and swap a fruit cup. Get the less-than-half-cup of fruit and it's sub par. Yes, winter, but isn't their ideal to use what is in season? I can still find some sort of fruit in grocery store that's decent and you're a major chain! Find a supplier. What really was disappointing was that my server up-charged me 1.99 for less-than-half-cup. Now I have worked in the past for many years. Yes, some swaps do require an additional charge, but really? I just gave you back potatoes and toast for clear fruit. She did take it off, but I'm sure she was doing what is practice. So if I would have paid for that it would have been over 10 bucks for two eggs, two pieces of bacon (which is a buck a piece on up charge on friend's sandwich) and coffee and basically three bites of fruit. \\n\\nEat n Park is the place for squiggly smiles.\",\n",
       " u'Possibly the worst dining experience I\\'ve had.  My husband and I were riding the bike trail in Pittsburgh and we decided to grab a bite to eat here since this location is right along the trail.  We noticed there were many tables open on the patio so we requested to sit outside.  It was rather busy inside so we waited patiently for 20 minutes until it was our turn to be seated.  The hostess then took us to a table inside the restaurant.  Not wanting to be rude, I asked if they were not putting anyone outside for some reason... She said the person who took our name didn\\'t indicate that we wanted to sit outside (however, I watched her write \"patio\" next to our name).  We were then led outside and told to sit where ever we wanted... Because it was still basically empty... \\n\\nFinally happy to be seated, we waited another 10 minutes or so for our waitress to come.  She asked if we were ready to order both our meals and drinks so we did.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks which we quickly drank because we were thirsty from riding.  We were able to get a refill before we got our food since it took over 40 minutes from the time we ordered it.  The waitress came back one more time after we were done eating and I asked it I could talk to someone about how long everything took but she did not seem interested.  No apology.   Nothing.  She simply said that sometimes they aren\\'t told when someone is seated outside.  Maybe that would explain the initial wait but why the terrible service after she clearly knew we were there?\\n\\nThis Eat\\'n Park is a joke.  Extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it.  The food was ok, but paying for that meal made me feel like I was being robbed.  A group of people at the table next to us walked out after waiting 10-15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge them.  Even when a woman at the table asked our waitress if she could order drinks, she just went inside and ignored them.  Whoever manages this restaurant should be ashamed!',\n",
       " u\"This has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront. From the second I walked in the door no one acknowledged my sister or myself for at least five to ten minutes, which I thought was weird because they were not busy. The manager, who was standing close and talking to another employee looked briefly at us, didn't smile or welcome us, turned and continued her conversation. We finally get sat at a booth that the hostess sloppily wiped off, left crumbs all over the seat and left old trash sitting on the table. We sat in the booth for ten minutes waiting for someone to come wait on us before I finally decided enough was enough and left. My sister loves Eat n Park but every time I enter the waterfront store I'm severely disappointed. \\n \\nI've been a manager and a cook at two very busy restaurants in Oakland for over six years so I know what I'm talking about. I have never let anyone stand in a doorway like that, I would wait on you myself until the waitress could get to you. It is appalling to see what that place has become. I will never go back to that place again.\",\n",
       " u\"From the last time I was here it was a complete one-eighty.  Our service was way above average, in fact our waitress was amazing.  She was attentive and even doted over my niece, it felt great to be welcomed and accommodated this time around.\\n\\nThis visit I was here with a bigger party than last time, but that didn't stop us from receiving some of the best service I have ever had at an ENP.  Food is standard, especially if you are like me and enjoy the salad bar.  It's not the hugest salad bar, but it has enough items on it to feel your stomach and then some.\\n\\nOh, and I rediscovered the grilled stickies.  O M G!  I forgot how much those ooey gooey grilled sticky buns of gold could be the perfect ending to a healthy meal. ;)\",\n",
       " u\"We had 20 people so we had our own room. The server Janee started off strong setting a tone for our meal that she would be organized and on point.  Unfortunately, that was the high point of this service.  We sat there for 20 minutes without drinks, in fact some meals started coming out and we still didn't have our beverages.  Half the table had Pepsi or Diet Pepsi, the other half had water and two people had dr. pepper.  I'm not sure why they couldn't just get pitchers.....I got the salad bar only, it was ok but it was messy so when you went to add items other items were mixed in which is kind of gross, I thought the chili was overly salty.  The other people we were with didn't have much good to say about their meals, with the exception of the angus burger.  Janee did stop and take a picture of our whole table which was nice and we were there three hours so she did earn her pay, but she set the expectation high that she knew what she was doing and it fell flat pretty fast.  I'm not sure it was all her fault as she didn't seem to have a staff that was working to support her, just catch her up as needed.  I think if you have 20 people at a table 2-3 staff members would make you more successful.  When we went to leave I bought a dozen of the sugar cookies.  The person at the counter didn't know how to ring them up and was quite rude when I asked for her to ring them up, like I was doing her a disservice by asking to purchase the restaurant's products.  That was my first time at Eat'n Park and I think I would prefer to just eat at Denny's next time.\",\n",
       " u'The waitress there are extremely rude .  On two occasions that I went there the same rudeness was there in 2 of the older wait staff.   Not sure what this is about..??  The first time a lady friend of mine did not order the Buffett and the watress tried to charge me..then proceeded to argue with me...lol..this morning.. another older last kept rolling her eyes at every quetion I had...lol...NEVER GO THERE AGAIN..',\n",
       " u\"To me TJ Maxx means great items at a great price!  They always have name brand handbags, jewelry, shoes, and clothing at a great price. You find shoes from Coach, clothes from Calvin Klein, and Jewelry from Betsy Johnson. They have purses from Michael Kors, , Coach, and Kate Spade plus many others. It's a great place to shop for items for your home, be it bedding or cookware that you need. Plus they have great decorative items as well. It's a great place to not only shop for yourself but for gifts. They have the best selection of frames around. It's all at great prices.\",\n",

At times I can find absolutely nothing. But not on this last trip. I scored my new favorite tank top for $2!! The H, in desperate need of new black work socks, found some for eight bucks! It was actually a 6 pack of socks, but came with an extra pair. So, 7 pairs of socks for $8....not too shabby.

       " u\"One of our favorite special occasion restaurants. Five stars for atmosphere. We enjoy the patio and the dining room. The food is superb and the service is also very good. Birthday and anniversary desserts on the house but no hassles like singing or incessant questions about the reason for your visit. One pointer/ don't go on Valentines without a reservation, but the same is true everywhere.\",\n",
       " u'Went here for happy hour.  Initially, service was prompt, but after the first drink order, we had to track a server down in the kitchen to take the food order.  It took so long to get, we just left.  \\nWill never go back.',\n",

I'd have loved to give them 5 stars, but I'd hold that till they add some nice local beers..\",\n",
       " u\"Whoever gave this place 4 or five stars must be out of their minds. Had dinner here in July and it was so so. I was looking for a fish place in town again, and figured, after reading positive reviews that it had improved. Yikes. Bad decision. \\n\\nThe staff seemed put out that anyone was here at all, and were seemingly puzzled by the menu. I watched two bartenders trying to figure out how to make a strawberry daiquiri for 5 minutes, which was admittedly entertaining. \\n\\nI ordered the chowder and the crab cakes. The chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes. I'm guessing that there may have been a clam or two in there somewhere, but you couldn't taste it if there was through the flour. \\n\\nThe crab cakes were definitely frozen, and not made from blue crab. If you're going to offer Chesapeake crab cakes, they had damn well better be the real deal. Zero flavor and dry as hell. Stringy, Asian crab that was definitely pre-made. Terrible. \\n\\nI don't like to rip a spot, but this was a seriously weak restaurant. Don't know why I expected western PA to offer up the goods, but if Chicago can do it well, why not Pittsburgh. Best analogy- the Olive Garden of seafood\",\n",
       " u'Not impressed at all!  The first time we ordered drinks our server forgot our drinks and the second time we had to ask if we could have more drinks.\\nI ordered, white frutti di mare for 24.49 and I only got 2 scallops and 3 small shrimps.  Our bill was $120. 00\\nWay to pricey for 2 scallops and pasta.',\n",
       " u'There really are not too many seafood options here in Pittsburgh. I have been here 3 times so far, and each time has been very good. This last Friday I walked in, and I was able to be seated immediately without a reservation. It was about 6:30 when we went in, and at about 8pm when we left, it was pretty packed. The seafood has always been good and fresh, and this was the first time in my life that I had swordfish and it was moist and tasty. They have a signature way of steaming their fish (if you ask for it this way) with ginger, sesame seeds and soy sauce over spinach and rice. It is excellent. They have a full bar, with a few good drafts (Guiness and Dogfish 60). Definitely pricey among the Waterfront restaurants, but to me it is worth it.',\n",
       " u'It depends on what you order here as this can be a reasonable meal or a splurge. They have some delicious tilapia/trout/salmon entrees with veggie and starch in that sweet spot of $20; however, if you want you could easily go $35+ a plate. The spinach salad with chevre and roasted pecans was awesome. \\n\\nWine was surprisingly reasonable and they were food allergy friendly.\\n\\nBetter than Red Lobster and not nearly as busy as PF Changs or Bravo!--so you might be able to walk in.\\n\\nWould give a 3.5 if I could.',\n",
       " u\"The food was delicious. Excellent seafood, and plenty of things to choose from on the menu. However, the service we experienced was terrible. We sat at our table for 10-15 minutes before anyone even noticed we were there. Keep in mind, we were here late afternoon/early evening so the place was half empty. Once we ordered my draft beer took 10 minutes to come out, then it was wrong. I kept it anyways or else I'd probably still be sitting there waiting for it. Good food, but I won't be in a hurry to go back.\",\n",
       " u\"First time in Pittsburgh on biz and staying in the Waterfront District. Nice selection of better than average chain restaurants on the area. Spotted Mitchell's Seafood and since I never heard of ot before, decided to make it my evening dinner choice - in fact, looked forward all day to a nice shellfish dinner ala Bonefish Grill. They have a nice al fresco patio overlooking the River that I wish I say at.  Place was pretty empty at 8 pm on a Monday night, but that's to be expected. I ordered the Seafood Americana which was supposed to have saut\\xe9ed shrimp and scallops in a light butter sauce. What I got in return was a plate of small shrimp in a brown gravy with NO scallops whatsoever. I immediately returned the dish and the young and nice manager came over to make it right, so I reordered a different steamed shrimp and scallops dish which was much better- 5 larger shrimp and 5 sea scallops over spinach and veggies with a soy sauce on the side - very nice but wish they had drained the ingredients better so they didn't end up on a soupy broth.  Having waited tables in a high end seafood restaurant through graduate school I am tempted to attributing this experience to Monday night, late dinner, inexperienced cooks, and lack of kitchen or server oversight. I hope your experience is better than mine. Too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry.  Disappointed.\",\n",
       " u'I have mixed feelings about this place. I have eaten there twice. I have enjoyed the flavors of their Shanghai option both times. The seafood has been cooked well. The Sharkfin pie is tasty for dessert. However, both times, I had shrimp as part of my entree. Mitchells is a perfect two for two at FORGETTING TO DE-VEIN the shrimp. First time I ate there two of my shrimp were not de-veined. Second time there was one (I only had two). If you order shrimp take a good look at it. The management has been very apologetic and helpful both times. They truly cared.',\n",
       " u\"Traveling with my boss, we had dinner here since it was convenient to the hotel. Food was good as usual but we ended up with a young man who had not been a waiter for very long. Brought us a bottle of Cabernet when we ordered a bottle of Chardonnay.  Told us he had never opened a bottle of wine before. Expected better service at a place like Mitchell's.\",\n",

       " u\"I took my daughter here for lunch. She had been wanting to come for a good while. She's graduating high school next week so it seemed like the perfect time. She had the clam chowder and the shrimp scampi. It was great. She wished that the chowder was slightly thinner but enjoyed the alfredo-like flavor. I was not in the mood for seafood so I had the bacon cheeseburger. You can't go wrong with a burger right? Well, let me tell you, that was one of the best burgers that I've had and I frequent restaurants who specialize in them. It had a beautiful char flavor to it. I did not need any condiments. The broccoli I had was wonderful as well and I especially enjoyed the seasoning.\\n\\nThe only thing that slightly sullied it for me is that it was too dark. I love atmosphere but I was almost asleep before the food came out.\",\n",

Told they ran out of bread and we could have crackers. Waited a half hour for our food.   Waitress said they were running behind in the kitchen and out of a lot of food. Asked the waitress to check on our food and waited for her to come back and when we saw her serving water to another group, we just left. Poor service and management.\",\n",
       " u\"very disappointing.  i have been a patron of this restaurant/location since it opened.....usually dining there about once a month.  my last few visits were fine, not great, but fine.  today was not.  the restaurant was about half full, i was with one other person.\\n     food---  my friend had a ceasar salad:  the staff didn't know where the anchovies were, therefore none.  it was served at room temperature.  chef's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp.  it also was served at room temperature.  i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables.  the scallops, too, were at room temperature and only seared on one side, some not at all.  the manager offered to redo the meals, which we accepted.  she shrugged her shoulders and said she didn't know what else she could do.  the scallops were better the 2nd time, penne was watery, crab was all but invisible.  the garnish had cheese on it the first time, not the 2nd.  penne was mediocre at best.\\n     service--- probably the worst service i've ever had there.  our server seemed overwhelmed, apologized continually to us and every other table she had nearby.  maybe that was part of the reason our meals were not hot the first time.  never did get a refill on iced tea.\\n     ambiance--- the place is starting to look tired.  the tables are showing their age.... the surface hasn't been kept up, the finish has long since worn off in the most used parts.\\n\\nsorry to see this place go down hill.  have many memories of better times.  may not ever go back.  looking for a new place in the area.\",\n",
       " u'Will not eat here again.\\n\\n1) Waitress (Angela) could not be found for 10+ minutes at a time. The entire meal was a running commentary on where she was and why we didn\\'t even get water refills until dinner came. She had to be specifically asked three times for water before we got our one and only refill.\\n\\n2) Spilled mussel butter on my jacket and although she did apologize no manager ever came over to see if we were okay. When I did complain they offered a $25 gift card which didn\\'t even cover the cost of said jacket, thanks but no thanks.\\n\\n3) When asked specifically if a dessert was served warm the waitress said \"yes, of course\" but spoiler alert it wasn\\'t. Party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something.\\n\\n4) When asked if they had a very specific after dessert drink the waitress replied in the affirmative only to substitute Irish coffee instead. If you are out of something just own up to it, don\\'t try to pull one over on someone.\\n\\nLong story short - decent if overpriced food, nonexistent management and the worst service I have experienced in a long while. As a server myself I am pretty forgiving but the (non)service ruined a $150 meal and Mitchell\\'s management couldn\\'t care less.',\n",
       " u\"After a long but beautiful day touring Pittsburgh and riding the Duquesne Incline we settled down for a late dinner at Mitchell's fish market.\\nWe were seated in a picture perfect spot by the window as requested. Our waiter initially greeted us warmly but the service went south quickly and I trying to wrap my head around - Why?  \\nWhat was wrong with the service you wondered. Well.....\\n*We had to wait a long time for our drinks \\n*appetizers ordered but not received.\\n* Requested bread several times waiter was oblivious to the request \\n* Dinner took for ever it felt like a century later\\n It was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste. \\nWe observed the other waiters and waitress was busy attending to their patrons. \\nOn the plus side the food was divinely delicious!  Salmon, scallops- Super fresh and melted in my mouth.  My husband's dish ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cakes and he hummed  yum to every bite he ate.  Unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand.  If only the head manager who was consistently walking around to various tables talking to patrons would have stop at our table we could have given him the scoop about our lack of service.  On well.\",\n",
       " u\"The food here is good, but also pretty pricey. You might get more mileage and value spending the same somewhere else. However, this would be nice for a business lunch. The decor and atmosphere is classy, and there is something for everyone on the menu--albeit it is all very seafood focused, of course.\\n\\nI've found the wait staff to be professional and personable.\\n\\nThis location has outdoor seating that overlooks the river.\",\n",
       " u\"Mitchell's...what have you done?!  I have been to this location several times and always loved it (just never got around to writing a review).  The patio area is great when the weather is nice and I've historically loved the fish preparations.   This last trip, though, was a pretty steep slide downhill.  \\n\\nFirst, I went to the bar and ordered a glass of the house pinot grigio...a generous poor from a bottle that was definitely a couple days past its prime.   You should know better.   \\n\\nThen onto the table.  I'm pretty sure the hostess double sat the server who was supposed to take care of me, because she expressed her frustration right in the middle of the patio area.  I waiting a few minutes and then someone else ended up taking care of me.   The service was fine, but I was a little put off by the start.  What really got me though was the menu.  Mitchell's used to have a great menu and I've always been thrilled with my selections.  I don't know what changed, but it was something.  I ordered the crispy ginger salmon with stir fried vegetables.   The portion was ample, but the fish was sort of mushy and the crispy ginger topping wasn't crispy at all.  The veges were half overcooked and half undercooked.  \\n\\nIf I didn't include this last visit, I'd have given it 4.5 stars.  This last visit brought it down.   Here's hoping that whatever changed, changes back.\",\n",
       " u\"Last night was my first visit to Mitchell's and I was really looking forward to some great seafood.  I am sorry to say I did not get it.  I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed.  There were five very small shrimp on the plate.  The shrimp were dry and overcooked.  The crab stuffing was mostly stuffing.  All I tasted was breading.  I didn't see a piece of lump crab anywhere.  The best part of the meal was the bread and butter.  I was with a party of 12 people and I was surprised to see such small portions on the others plates.  For the prices at this place, I had hoped for so much more.  I will not go back.\",\n",
       " u'I have tried time and time again, to get myself to like this place and every time it\\'s more disappointing than the last time. \\n\\nI had a take out order today, and when I called to place the order, I could tell that instantaneously, the bartender taking my order was not going to be a pleasure. Well that was an understatement. \\n\\nWhen I arrived to pick up my order, there was class A attitude from the minute I walked in with the bartender. Then I had a total of 5 bags and 2 fountain drinks (which she said she had absolutely nothing to put them in for me), and I asked her if she could help me carry the bags to my car.  Her reply \"no. I have tables I need to take care of.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t expect over-the-top service at this restaurant, but I do expect a smile, a nice and pleasant attitude, along with a little helpfulness. If you aren\\'t having a good day, don\\'t take it out on customers.',\n",
       " u\"They we're so accommodating for my daughter that doesn't like seafood. The food and service was very good.\",\n",
       " u\"I love eating in the beautiful river setting (though it is right by where the bloody Homestead Steel Strike took place in 1892).  I would have given this place a higher rating based on past visits.  But my most recent experience was not quite as good.  The waitress spoke too fast, and gave me misinformation about what sides came with the plank of fish.  She did offer to fix the mistake, but I let it go and traded sides with another person who was with me. I think broiled is better than the plank.  I still will eat at Mitchell's at least once each time I visit Pittsburgh.  The food is healthy, and I enjoy being there.\",\n",
       " u'I want to like this place more than I do. Its definitely at least decent. It\\'s a family style seafood restaurant that has a bit of class to it. Pretty nice visually, and service is good as well, especially at the front desk. I\\'ve taken a couple of people there for birthdays and they do a nice job with that without being obnoxious with the ceremony. If you make a birthday reservation you can actually get \"Happy Birthday Bob!\" or whatever printed on your menus for the evening. Nice touch. \\n\\nFood is just solid, that\\'s why I don\\'t give them more stars. I\\'ve had a few things here and there\\'s nothing special about their flavors, although their presentations are nice. I\\'ve been a couple of times and haven\\'t had anything I\\'d be excited about. Basically a safe, family style, classier mid-scale seafood choice.',\n",
       " u'After doing some chores at The Waterfront, we were hungry and decided to try Mitchell\\'s for dinner. We were seated at a comfortable red booth. The clam chowder was perfect; definitely get it. The mussels were delicious--not as firm as mussels usually are (but in a good way) and bigger than normal. The spicy crispy shrimp surprised me; I didn\\'t think it would be good, but it was. Boyfriend said his lobster bisque was \"funky\" and I agreed that it tasted weird, but it was still edible. \\n\\nThe calamari, however, was unseasoned. Maybe they forgot to season it that night? I feel like the way it was served to us is not the way they usually serve it. Also, I was disappointed with the small portion of the calamari. For $12, we should be getting way more than we did. \\n\\nOur server was attentive and noticed that we liked a lot of their appetizers, so she informed us about their happy hour (Monday through Friday 4:30-6:30pm) where their appetizers are at most $7 each! Tempting, especially after our pleasant dinner experience.\\n\\nTaste | 4\\nAtmosphere | 4\\nPresentation | 3.5\\nService | 4\\nOVERALL | 4',\n",
       " u\"This is a really hard review for me to write, simply because I cannot for the life of me find the words to explain the food. Lackluster, no, not really...Mediocre...no....Pedestrian/average/common...huh uh. Just 'eh.' It wasn't awful, terrible or even bad, and it wasn't great, good or even fine. It was just....edible, I guess.  \\nWe started with shrimp dumplings from the happy hour menu and the BF got seafood gumbo. I thought the gumbo was decent; he said 'eh', however we both agreed the dumplings were 'eh'. \\nI got something called the market trio, which came with creole style rice, corn, a crab cake, a hunk of salmon and 5 shrimp. It wasn't terrible, inedible food, it was just....not good. And for $28 I wish I would have just gotten a bowl of the gumbo. The only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice. The BF got a crab and lobster stuffed cod, which again, was not bad just not good. It had a lemony-buttery sauce, that didn't taste quite lemony or buttery somehow. \\nI know this is a stupid thing to gripe about, but I hatehatehate when restaurants charge necessarily high prices for pop. Soda, cola, pop, call it what you want, but it should never be more than $2.50. I usually just drink water with lemon, but I had a headache, so I ordered a coke. $325!! And having a BF who works for a restaurant, I know that pop costs them pennies! I see $2-2.50; some people drink glass after glass of the stuff, but $3.25 is simply ridiculous. Especially when the food kinda sucks. And I read other reviews and the decor is not classy. It's like it's trying to be classy, but real classy restaurants know its' not classy. It was a little like an over-priced, under-flavored Red Lobster without the kickass cheese biscuits. But when your food sucks at Red Lobster, you can always fill up on the delicious biscuits.\",\n",
       " u\"So I've never been here before, I came with a friend and her aunt. The place is decorated really well, a little dim though. Even the bathroom is really really dim. Like I get the atmosphere you're trying to go for but I want to be able to see.\\nI got the seafood stew and it was so good. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the flavor of the broth was fantastic. My shrimp were over cooked though, thus the four star review. They got everything right but that one thing kinda tainted it.\\nI had the banana bread pudding for dessert and that was also very good. I've had a lot of bread pudding and this was one of the best. It was light but also dense and the flavor of the banana came through very clearly.\\nOverall I had a very good experience! It would have been very great if it weren't for the over cooked shrimp. I'd definitely go back, but it is pretty pricey.\",\n",
       " u\"I have visited this Old Navy location four or five times over the past year and have never had an issue. In fact, a friend and I visited the store around Christmastime and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. \\n\\nHowever, this was the not my experience yesterday. I drug my husband along, so I could look for new jeans and maybe find some sweaters / winter clothes on sale. \\n\\nThere were signs up exclusively for Old Navy credit card users, which I am not. However, the 'sale' of buy two, get one free on thermals ended on January 7th (two days prior). Then, there was regular sign that simply stated 'buy two, get one free'. I was confused as to whether this applied to everyone, or just O. N. card users. So, I find an employee (the only one on the floor...) and she says that the sale applies to everyone, that the one for credit card holders is 'old'. Well, take it down, right?!\\n\\nAt checkout, there are cashiers, both waiting on one customer, no one else in line. The male cashier does not have his light on, so I opt for the other lane. There is a cashier, a woman, and what appears to be a manager, a younger woman. There is some issue regarding the patron's purchase. From what I can figure she opened up an O. N. card and was supposed to get a discount, but it didn't come off her total. \\n\\nMy husband and I stood in line for several minutes. No one even looked at us...not even to say 'sorry, be right with you'...something. No acknowledgement whatsoever. Me, already being cursed with an impatient personality, gather my items and move to the other register after about five minutes. I ask the male cashier if he can ring me up. He says that he can, when he's done with the current customer. (duh...) I say, 'great, thanks, I wasn't sure since you're light isn't on.' To which he just shrugs. Ummm....\\n\\nNeedless to say, not the best of experiences this time. Just hoping that maybe some college kids called off or something and that they were understaffed. Will return, but not for the customer service....\",\n",
       " u\"This is an older Dick's Sporting Goods location. Come here for the basics but don't expect to find the huge assortment that you would find at other DSGs throughout the city. I wandered around here for 15 minutes or so one evening and did not have anyone approach me, asking if I needed assistance. I also found a small child in the back of the store playing dangerously on one of the elliptical machines, which is something that both his parents and the store's staff should have addressed. Overall, I'll go here if I need sporting goods basics but would rather drive a little further to a nicer location.\",\n",

We did self checkout so can't comment on the employees.\",\n",
       " u'My experience at Big Bang Bicycles was what I have been looking for in the western Pa. area. I have been looking for trusted advice concerning a new road bike and proper fitting during the purchase process.  I am 6\\'4\" and I found out quickly that regardless of the time of the year, it was very difficult to find a shop which stocked bikes of quality that I could properly test ride.  Big Bang and owner Glenn couldn\\'t have been more patient of all my questions and concerns.  His knowledge is remarkable and he took his time fitting me and explaining the process. He had several bikes I could demo in my size.  After deciding on a model to order Glenn, Craig, and Samson who I had the pleasure of working with, continued to help me through ordering the bike, getting it assembled upon delivery, and taking a significant amount of time going through the bike with me and how to maintain it properly. The shop has an amazing variety of helmets, clothing, and other things that a cyclists might want to purchase. Even though I live in the north hills, if I need anything from service to merchandise, I will not hesitate to go to Big Bang Bicycles.  Glenn and the others that work at the shop are well worth the trip.',\n",
       " u'I am a novice rider looking to customize my bike and very intimidated to walk into the shop. Glen and the staff answered all of my questions and made it so easy to make my riding experience more comfortable. I would recommend this shop to bicyclist of any experience level!',\n",
       " u\"I've lived in 3 cities before coming to Pittsburgh, and I have not received service anywhere better than this place. Their prices and selection are unparalleled elsewhere in the city.

Glenn, Craig and the ENTIRE team effectively demonstrated technical expertise, a passion for the sport and most importantly, a deep respect for their customers. I not only witnessed it myself but witnessed it with other customers while I was waiting. \\n\\nWhether you're new to the sport or a long time cyclist seeking a new and better experience, there simply is no better shop than Big Bang. Their selection, access and overall service is simply unreal. Enjoy this place, it's a treat.\",\n",

No one will be waiting on you... refilling your ice water every five minutes. This isn't a deal breaker. Besides, you get your food in about 10-15 minutes and it's hot, and delicious!\\n\\nCompetition... there honestly isn't any. The next closest place by comparison is either China Buffet in Century Square, or P.F. Changs. And I don't want buffet, and I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for some simple Chinese food.

Friday: Sherrys Pasta e\\'Fagoli $3.75 per serving Wednesday/Saturday: (MY FAVORITE SPECIAL):  Homemade Lasagna - made with homemade sauce, Tallutos lasagna pasta, grande and lamagna cheese and ricci ground hot sausage $4.25 per serving.  I must tell you that the lasagna is my favorite menu item at Ricci and anytime I get it .. when I eat it.. I get into a \"zone\". And I don\\'t ever share.. yes it\\'s THAT good.\\n\\nI love to make my own spaghetti sauce using Ricci Italian Sausage.  I have tried using other types of sausages - like giant eagle brand but you can always tell when its \"Ricci\\'s Sausage\" because it\\'s a good batch of sauce and everyone raves about it.    \\n\\n\\nmangia mangia',\n",
       " u'I would give our experience zero stars. Possible negative stars. It\\'s Valentine\\'s Day. An order was placed weeks in advance for a delivery. My boyfriend went to the shop to ask where the delivery was and the woman at the counter could not have cared less that he was perturbed. Weather conditions are not ideal for deliveries today but no attempt was made to communicate that the delivery would be delayed. Just a little \"hey, someone is sending you something special, we\\'re doing the best we can\". Placate us! \\n\\nI received a call at 5:30 saying I needed to be home to receive the delivery! Where\\'s the surprise in that? What if it\\'s just a regular day and I\\'m getting surprise flowers, would I have to get them myself if I wasn\\'t home? Well, my flowers are not being delivered today. My arrangement is sitting at the shop because I was chosen to be the loser of \"who gets their flowers on time\". \\n\\nThe surprise of my arrangement was also ruined by the shop when they said what it was, how beautiful it was and I\\'d be very happy. Well, we\\'re not happy at all about the service. At all. Don\\'t know how this place is still in business with the awful customer service.\\n\\n\\nEdit: my flowers were delivered at 1:05 on 2/15 after I told the shop they needed to be delivered by 1:00. They were given a range of 9-1. I was offered a box of Whitman\\'s chocolate as an apology. Really? How about a refund. The arrangement my boyfriend selected is gorgeous but the flowers are wilted and spotted already. I\\'m pretty sure they ruined any future chances of me getting surprise delivery flowers.',\n",
       " u\"Cyril did my sister's wedding and now is working on things for my brother's wedding.  He is wonderful to work with.  Helpful in every way.  My sister's flowers were stunning.\",\n",
       " u\"The food was ok nothing to rave about but nothing to be to dissapointed about either. I ordered a sandwich with extra meat and was highly dissapointed. I called in to try and get it corrected the guy pretty much brushed me off telling me that's how the do it. I'll let you be the judge by the pic. Well after telling him that i was going to give negative review, he said i was threating him and for me to write my review and hung on me. I waited a few minutes let things simmer down called back and he did send over a free sandwich which was nice, just wish he could have done that from the start. Overall it's decent late night food at a reasonable price, but honestly there's better options during normal operating hours.\",\n",
       " u'The food here is pretty good which is disappointing because the service is terrible. About 50% of the times we have ordered from here they somehow managed to screw up the food.. tonight they screwed up 2 of the 4 items we ordered! I dont know if the person taking the orders has hearing problems or is just being very careless but either way its very irritating getting food I didnt order.. even if its still good food...',\n",
       " u\"My boyfriend and I ordered the R&B's Special Pie (no bacon) last night and the greek salad (added artichokes).  So good!  The pizza was one of the best I have had in a long time, and I eat a lot of pizza! The salad was huge and fed us both easily.  It certainly wasn't as cheap as Dominos, but the quality was great and so delicious.  I would give R&Bs at least $$ when it comes to price, but if you are willing to pay the extra money for good quality, then I highly recommend this pizza joint.\",\n",
       " u\"These guys make excellent hoagies. We especially like the supreme Italian and the turkey. Try their pizza, excellent. Don't add too many toppings, you will disguise the great taste of the sauce and the dough. I suggest either plain or pepperoni.\",\n",
       " u\"They took me right in and I didn't have to wait. They were extremely fast and courteous. Some people complain about they trying to upsell services, and normally I hate when places do that, but I never felt pushed. There were two things that he recommended I do within in the next six months, and I already knew about them. I've seriously waited longer in some fast food drive thrus!\",\n",
       " u'Great service, in and out in a timely manor.  No pressure at all to purchase any additional unwanted services.  Will be back!!',\n",
       " u'The pizza was ok. It is been the best my husband and I have had in this area. They seem to be the most \"authentic\" compared to other pizza delivery shops in this area.',\n",
       " u\"I was one of their first customers starting at the old location. I live further away now, but will stop anytime I am near as they quite simply have the BEST PIZZA period of anywhere I've been. I have referred many friends and family and they all say the same. The owners and staff are very friendly and caring people and treat you like family. The other food is good too, especially the wedding soup, although 95% of the time we get the great pizza. The dough, sauce and cheese are second to none.\",\n",
       " u\"Luigi's is everything I expected it to be.  A decent place to order an authentic looking and  tasting pizza.  I usually prefer New York style and Luigi's offers it by the slice.  I also ordered lasagna off of their daily lunch menu .  I think there are at least 6 regularly featured menu items to choose from and a drink is included.  Luigi's has a large dining area or customers can walk up to the take out counter if they choose.\",\n",
       " u'This is the place that is close to my house so I go here all the time.\\nThey are usually pretty good and they definitely got better.\\nThe orders come out pretty fast and the employers are nice',\n",
       " u\"We ordered from here because Uncle Chen, our go-to takeout place down the road, was closed. \\n\\nI ordered the General Tso tofu, a favorite dish of mine, and hubby ordered the beef Mei Fun noodles. We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\\n\\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\\n\\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.\",\n",
       " u\"Love their sesame chicken!!! I eat it all the time and it's just enough to be stuffed and have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch! They are fast making the food as well and if you call in they will have it ready by the time you get there!\",\n",
       " u'I just moved into my new apartment in the area and called for a take out order. The place had received good reviews so I thought \"Why not?\" I was hung up on twice before I could even get my order out. We were finally able to place an order and told 5-10 minutes. We live 15 minutes from this restaurant and we left immediately after placing the order. Ten minutes later, my phone rings and it is the man who took our order telling me that he was closed and would not wait for us to get there to pick up our food because he had told us 5-10 minutes. If you are going to order from here, please make sure you stick to their timelines. And if you do go to pick it up and make it there in time, it is very hard to find.',\n",

       " u'Im writing this out of anger.  So bare with me.  I was desperate for a place under $70/night.  I  AM NOT A PICKY PERSON!  I was homeless in Texas for 3 months on the streets once.   Life has turned around for me since then.  \\n\\nThe Avalon motel is a sesspool of filfth and disease. I am NOT exaggerating!  HOW IN HELL DID THIS PLACE PASS A HEALTH INSPECTION. BULL!   I checked in at 8pm on a thursday night.  Got my key, and walked in. LOOKED HORRIFYING, But what the hell.  I was tired and just needed a warm half clean bed to sleep in.  I peeled back the sheets and noticed tons of little black spots on the pillows and sheets.  The closer I looked I realized there were tiny smears of blood all over the sheets, too.  That alarmed me because those are sure signs of bed bugs.  So I peeled back the fitted sheet and OMG!!!!  Dead dried bed bug carcasses, bed bug poop, blood splotches all lined the entire length of the mattress.  not exaggerating.\\n\\nI had the misfortune of living in an apartment building once that became infested with bed bugs after I bought a used mattress off Craigslist.  IT WAS HELL getting rid of them- even after throwing the mattress out.  If ONE EGG gets on your property, your done.  Every night you will go to bed and be unable to fall asleep because you feel them crawling on you. Once you finally DO manage to fall asleep you will wake up the next morning to dozens of bites all over your body that can inflame into the size of dimes and ooze puss.  They itch bad and take Weeks to dissappear.\\n\\nAS SOON AS I saw the bed bugs (5 minutes after entering the room) I went back to the clerk and kindly demanded my money back on grounds that the room was not up to health code.  I could put up with the other deplorable disgusting repulsive problems with the room, but I DREW THE LINE AT SLEEPING WITH LIVE PARASITES IN MY BED.    WTF.\\n\\nI begged for my money back and explained that proir to check in I only had $100 in my bank account and spent half of it on the room and did not have enough money left to go to another hotel.  And asked repeatedly to PLEASE get my money back for a room that I had NOT EVEN USED and JUST purchased 10 minuted prior. The clerk refused and toted their beloved \"Health Department Approval Certificate\"  how in the hell they got it---I dont know.  Had to be fake.   She called me a liar and said there were no bed bugs and no one else has complained.  I practically begged her to walk to the room with me so I could show her the obvious HUNDREDS of bed bugs infesting the entire room.  Her response?  .....\"  Oh Im not going out there, its cold! \"  .....These are the kind of people were dealing with folks. And she  proudly kept my $50 and said I was welcome to go sleep in my car in the 6 degree weather.  Disgusting people who live to cheat citizens out of their money. The epitome of whats wrong with the world.  Very SAD,   Oh yeah..... so, don\\'t stay here.',\n",
       " u\"This motel is so ghetto, even the bedbugs carry guns. Don't stay here unless you're looking to indulge your sense of urban adventure. Fact: this motel has an hourly rate. Think of that what you will. The only good thing I can say about the Avalon Motel is, no one has gotten murdered here... recently.\",\n",
       " u\"Got bit up . Bed bugs wouldn't believe me I had to show my bite marks .. Even then refused to acknowledge me\",\n",
       " u\"We stopped through the drive -thru last night after helping my sister move. It was midnight and thankfully something was open. I ordered nuggets fries and a frosty. My sister ordered the same and Bobby ordered two Jr. Bacon cheeseburgers. Well only one burger was in the bag (we found out halfway Down the road) Bobby said the other burger was dry and they forgot the mayo, & my sisters fries had no salt on them lso she says.. Mine were fine but I kept that to myself to avoid her eating some of mine. Typical older sibling.)\\n\\nAnyways I don't normally review fast food that I've had bad experience at bc it happens often, but totally forgetting a burger is not cool..\",\n",
       " u'TERRIBLE! No one expects fast food to be gourmet, but this experience would make corporate cry! Ordered food for 2 adults (full meals) and for one child and was charged for 2 more adult meals, I asked why the amount was so high and the employee said nothing to me, looked the other way and yelled for a manager. Still feeling over charged but not wanting to agitate the situation any further we left with 1 less drink then we ordered, cold food and a soda water instead of sprite because no one changed the syrup. Never again.',\n",
       " u\"We keep expecting their food to be better than the last time. I've had enough. Ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around 5 o'clock. You'd think the food would be fresh during the dinner-time rush. Well, you'd be wrong. The sandwiches and fries were all lukewarm, and both chicken filets were so dry and tough that they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. We ordered an unsweetened iced tea and a Sprite with no ice. Received an unsweetened tea with no ice and a cup of ice with some Sprite in it.\\n\\nWe've previously been treated rudely for having the gall to use the drive thru 20 minutes before closing time. I'm trying to remember if we have ever been served a satisfactory meal there, but I'm having trouble coming up with a single example. I can only assume that the manager is never there or is so incompetent as to defy belief. This location coasts by solely on the reputation of other Wendy's. Do yourself a favor. Go to Burger King or McDonald's down the road, or hike up to the Wendy's at West View Park.\",\n",
       " u\"My puppy was admitted here 6 days ago. In very poor shape. I was scared he wasn't going to make it. And being it was my 4 yr Olds new dog made things a bit harder on us. They called 2-3 days a day with updates and did everything they could to help renegade and to also make me feel better. 6 days later my puppy came home and is still in recovery. But doing alot better.i can't thank there entire staff enough for saving my dog.!! Will continue to take my dogs there and recommend them to everyone I know! Special thanks to Dr v and Lenny !\",\n",
       " u\"The only vet I will use from now on! The staff is amazing! From the receptionist to the vet. It really does take a team to provide great service. I was bringing my cat in as a new patient with concerns about his back leg. They fit me in the next day! I called them at 4:30 pm on Monday and they had me in Tuesday at 5:30! This alone was amazing on account that the vet I use to take him to never returned my calls. The vet (Kouch I maybe spelling that wrong) was so patient with my not so happy cat. She diagnosed the issue. It was his poor back. They filled a prescription, updated his shots, and didn't run any test that weren't necessary. I want to trust the vet to provide the care that my animal needs, not run me through the ringer. I will do anything for my cat. For them to be honest about what is necessary and what's not put my mind at ease that he was getting the treatment he needed and no unnecessary test that would only stress him out.  Great job! Hopefully we will be back for just shots but if anything else does come up you will be seeing me and tyty again.\",\n",
       " u\"They do NOT care about animals.  I had been taking bothof my dogs there for 4 years for regular veterinary care. My youngest dog came down with stomach cancer while I was unemployed, she needed to be euthanized and I made an appointment, put my poor bloated sick dog into the car and took her for her final visit.  They demanded I pay up front before she was even seen by a vet and I asked for billing, having been a years-long patient who has always paid I didn't think it would be an issue, especially considering the pain my dog was in.  They refused to do the euthanization and would rather leave a sick animal (years long animal patient of theirs! ) in pain and suffering than to do the courtesy of sending a bill to a regular customer.  DISGUSTING.   Who does that? Never will I take another animal there, I now have a new vet that actually cares about animals and how they feel and whether they are in pain.\",\n",
       " u\"Don't let their name fool you!  This establishment specializes in other goods and gifts other than flowers..  They have a very nice collection of jewelry, clothing, handbags, seasonal decorations, and much more. There is even an antique store on the lower level of their shop.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They have regular open house events for the holiday season.  Very comfortable environment.\",\n",
       " u\"Love,love,love Lincoln Bakery! My absolute favorite is the chocolate pudding cake. It comes with mounds of chocolate shavings on top. They also gave fantastic carrot cake and cheese cakes. Always something delicious in the pastry counter. \\n\\nThe seasonal cakes are always so creative and fun to look at in the window.\\n\\nThe staff there is pretty great as well. Especially Dottie. She's been there for years and is always so kind.\",\n",
       " u\"I'd give this a true 3.5, but am rounding up in good faith. I walked in to get an iced cake for a going away party. I knew I might have to sacrifice quality because I didn't place a call-ahead order.\\n\\nThe cake was delicious--icing was creamy and not too sweet. I was happy there were about 5 different pre-made cakes I could choose from: vanilla, chocolate and marble in pink, blue and green styles. Workers were friendly and helpful. (Lady said the burnt almond torte was a customer favorite so I'll be back to try!)\\n\\nWhat I was disappointed with was the icing job. Felt like I could have done a better job with spacing and lettering than the worker who helped me. She may have been inexperienced but I expect someone working at a bakery to at least be able to write the basics. Feel like it ruined an otherwise lovely cake. \\n\\nThere was a wide selection of cookies, cakes (large and individual sizes) and fresh-baked donuts. I'll be back to try more from this local bakery, just be wary about getting cakes iced on the spot!\",\n",
       " u\"Lincoln Bakery is a top notch bakery in the Pittsburgh area which I feel is on par with other high ranking bakeries in the area such as Prantls and Oakmont Bakery.  I love that they have slices of many of their cakes and cheesecakes available for individual purchase.  I purchased an assortment of these to take to a dinner party and they were all gobbled up and it was a great way to allow everyone to try small bites of a variety of treats.  My personal favorite was the Chocolate Mousse cake because I love chocolate and it was sweet without being overly sweet, creamy, with the right balance of sweet and bitter from the chocolate.  I also sampled the tiramisu which was delicate with just a hint of espresso and the cream was perfect.  The best thing was that while the desserts were all obviously sweet they weren't so sweet that it was sickening as I've experienced with more commercial cakes from grocery or big box stores.  The other cakes that I bought and all of which the dinner attendees loved were the lemon cake, the oreo cheesecake, one called the sweet spot that had chocolate and peanut butter, and finally a white cake with chocolate frosting.  It is close to my neighborhood so I will definitely return the next time that I need baked goods for a special occasion.  They are closed on Sunday, but the great thing is that they have extended hours the rest of the week until 8 PM M-F and until 7 PM on Saturdays.\",\n",
       " u'My new favorite stop.  If you like carrot cake this is certainly the place to try  and  you will not be disappointed!  Truthfully, I did not know what to expect during my first visit but everything I have purchased since then  has been fresh and satisfying.',\n",
       " u'Had to make a trip to Leetsdale to visit a client and found myself in an area where I struggled to find a place for goodies.  \\n\\nA quick yelp search revealed Lincoln Bakery.\\n\\nThis place is awesome and it is now saved in my GPS for future stops.  Highly recommend.',\n",

       " u\"DO NOT BUY FROM METRO MOTORS ( BOB ) .i read ad on auto trader that had car listed with auto windows sunroof and many more options. Drove 45 minutes to look at vehicle to find it had no extras at all.Discussing with owner I placed 100 dollars Sarurday at closing and called Monday at 9 am to tell him I wasn't interesred.He kept deposit claiming I broke contract. This Dealer is the worst type of Used Car Dealer and the reason they get a bad reputation.  AVOID METRO MOTORS UNLESS YOU WANT RIPPED OFF. Turned Metro Motors into BBB and after investigating said they would leave negative review on Metro Motors for 3 years.\",\n",

Do yourself a favor and stop in for your next vehicle.  These Folks go above and beyond to ensure a delightful buying experience!',\n",
       " u\"My beef was so raw that I had to put it in the microwave for two minutes. It was even slightly cold before I reheated it. The manager says they cook it medium rare, and I explained it was so rare it ate the lettuce off of the sandwich! \\n\\nNeither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the BLT had much bacon. (How do I post pictures?) For a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon, this fell WAY short. The little bit of bacon it did have was burnt. Really Arby's? I told the manager I have no idea how they thought sending out a sandwich like that was acceptable.\\n\\nOverall, this made a horrible day worse. I was celebrating my two oldest girls' graduation from high school, and what was supposed to be a very nice dinner was a disaster. We went to Arby's as a back up so I had at least a little something to eat. That was equally disastrous. At least the fries were okay, albeit a little soft and mushy for some reason. \\n\\nBased on this experience, I would not go back. Based on this experience, I would most definitely not recommend this to others.\",\n",

       " u\"Kuhn's is the perfect grocery store for Bellevue! Staff are friendly and helpful and the store is small enough to navigate in a few minutes which makes it great for picking up weekly groceries. \\n\\nAlways happy with the produce and fresh fruit selections--I even bought kale there last week. Deli is busy after work and for good reason. Fair prices and a big selection of meats, cheeses and side dishes. \\n\\nGrocery store is open til MIDNIGHT throughout the week (closes earlier on Sundays...9?) so you can run in for those last minute things.\\n\\nThere's also a Redbox out front so when your friend has a breakup, swing by for ice cream and a chick flick. Compliments of Kuhn's!\",\n",
       " u\"Wow. An actual neighborhood grocery store. Not the wannabe monopoly monster bird ripping people off left and right, but an actual neighborhood grocery store.\\n\\nIf you're seeking the gourmet fancy-schmancy, or the self-restrictive dietary vegan-gluten-free blah blah blah, your choices may be a little more limited, but if you're a 'normal' eater, it's a grocery store that has all of the basics and a few frills. No one will speak to you with a fake Hampton accent dahhhhhling, and you won't find a wine-tasting class with a gourmet fritter exhibition.\\n\\nWhat you will find are regular folk who are helpful and (mostly) friendly, the usual grocery store variety of necessities and non-necessities, a nicely stocked and priced meat and produce case, a deli counter with the usual meats and cheeses and a variety of prepared foods, baked goods. It's clean and tidy, and you can stock your fridge and pantry as you see fit, and with a pleasant 'How ya doin'?'\\n\\nKuhn's still does the double-coupon thing, and they have some pretty good sales - ten boxes of pasta for ten bucks, the weekly soda sales - three fridge packs for nine bucks beats monster bird's $12.\\n\\nNow I will say that on occasion, it will feel a little like you've somehow been sucked into deep Appalachia in regard to some of the clientele, but that's pretty much everywhere in da burgh that's on the 'outskirts'. Sometimes I look around me and half expect to find a rusty 1950's pick up truck full of goats in the parking lot, or a trailer park nearby.\\n\\nI generally do my 'staple' shopping at Aldi, and my meat needs in the Strip, but for a nearby quick fill in, unless it's an ingredient for a specialty recipe, Kuhn's is great for the 'Oh crap - I need' kind of trip.\\n\\nAnd quite frankly, as nice as they are, and decently priced as they are, this small business deserves our business more than the cut throat monster bird.\",\n",
       " u\"Like time traveling back to the sixties, this store barely meets the basics. Small, dingy, dated, and very limited in selection...but at least it's convenient and walkable for those in the surrounding area. \\n\\nDon't go looking for really fresh or exotic produce. The produce section is tiny and mostly prepackaged. Meat section? Also limited. The deli section is small, but friendly and efficient...again, it carries the basics.\\n\\nCheckout can be slow. If you're in the middle of making dinner or baking and need a quick missing ingredient, this is the place for a quick stop as long as you can use the express lane.  Otherwise, it's worth the trip to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Wal-Mart or even Giant Eagle. Basic is okay and so is this Kuhns.\",\n",

First of all, it is super convenient . \\nSecondly, its a journey into my past when most  grocery stores were set up like this and I would see neighbors encountering  other neighbors who gladly took the time to find out how each other's families were doing  This  hometown feel is priceless... Thirdly, I usually find exactly what I need for just about the same amount of money I spend elsewhere.  This community is well served with the presence and dedication of Kuhn's Market and it's employees.\",\n",

       " u'I have never been treated so terrible in my whole life. Here\\'s my rant, a friend and I stopped in one day after high school. I was a senior at a catholic private school at the time so I was required to wear a fancy uniform so I looked highly presentable. I picked a shirt up I was thinking of getting and held it as we browsed through the store. They announced they were closing and I was across the store from where I got the shirt. Deciding not to get it, I placed it on a near by shelf. My friend checked out, and as we were walking out of the store a  woman that worked there said to me \"where is the shirt you were holding\". I told her I had placed it on the self in the back, and said sorry for not putting it back. She said \" I walked back there and didn\\'t see it, so where is it\" and clearly implied that i stole it.  I told her again that it was on the shelf as nice as I could and she then told me that she didn\\'t believe me and told me to go back there and get it or else she was going to search me. Now I get that it doesn\\'t matter that the shirt was 50 cents because stealing is still wrong but because I didn\\'t steal it and told her so I feel Im justified in being furious that I was publicly humiliated and falsely accused over 50 cents. I walked to the back of the store picked it up and started walking back and then the lady said in a grossly rude tone \" well I didn\\'t see it back there\" no apology, no nothing. I handed it to her and walked out. I\\'ve never been there since. I was so angry I forgot to get her name tag so I could complain to the manager. I have never been treated so badly by anyone let alone a complete stranger and store clerk. I don\\'t shop at stores that hire such terrible staff.',\n",

Cash only - no credit cards but ATM is on site.  \\n\\nThe mention of \"no fitting rooms\" often peppered throughout some reviews.   I am not one that tries on clothes so that doesnt bother me.  I just wing it and it always works out.\\n\\nThe ample space for parking is no doubt a bonus.  It\\'s easy to get in and out via route 65.',\n",

That's the type of brunch place this is.\\n\\nPrices are very reasonable: basic breakfasts (eggs, pancakes, omlettes) weren't over $6.95 and even the specials were only $8 or $9.\\n\\nI got the eggs benedict which is my go-to, however I didn't care for this version. Instead of hollandaise sauce, the dish comes with CHEESE sauce. Not my favorite that it came on a thin English muffin either, but our potatoes were good. (Two options: deep fried and pan fried with onions. We got both and thought the deep fried were best. Can you blame us?!)\\n\\nTotal bill for 2 came to $20. I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of their other breakfasts!\",\n",
       " u'Great home style breakfast, sandwiches and dinner. Joe has something great going on here. Waitresses have been there for years as well, and they are very good.',\n",
       " u\"The Rusty Nail is a neighborhood diner-style restaurant that serves Pittsburgh-centric comfort foods.  Meatloaf, pasta, and hot roast beef all grace the menu.\\n\\nI came here with my dad who ordered a hot roast beef, and I ordered a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs.  Both meals were right around $10 and delicious.  The portions were huge, and the waitstaff was very friendly.\\n\\nI'm guessing it was the owner, but a nice guy came around asking everyone how their food was and making small talk.  Nice touch.\",\n",
       " u'Go there to get some authentic home made breakfast ! They have breakfast special and price is very reasonable !',\n",
       " u'This is an established, neighborhood restaurant in the heart of Bellevue.  I found the place by accident, when I made a trip to the Lincoln Bakery across the street (you have to stop there also - old fashioned bakery with lots of very bad stuff, if you\\'re on a diet).\\nStreet parking only, and you have to feed the meter.  I also found that it is a cash-only restaurant as well.  No hostess, so you just walk in and seat yourselves.  The wait staff consists mostly of older, seasoned \"waitresses\", as they call themselves,  and the ambiance isn\\'t fancy at all.\\nThe pot roast (Thurs & Sunday) is to die for!!!.  When I offered my compliments to the chef, Joe, the owner personally accepted it with a hearty handshake and a thank you and commented that he starts the pot roast, on the days it is offered, at 5:30 am.\\nI try to get there close to 4 pm.  after that, the place fills up with a lot of locals, some of  whom related that they have been eating there for a long time.\\nI can\\'t comment on breakfast or lunch, but the menu offered a lot of different items, so........',\n",
       " u'Not a fan. I\\'ve been here twice in the past six months and both times the person working was rude and unfriendly. It might have been the same worker both times. Tonight, we walked in and went up to the counter with our beer. The guy looked at us for a second then continued doing whatever he was doing behind the glass. I\\'m not sure what. We were not acknowledged at all and we waited some more. We finally had to ask if we could pay for our beer. He looked up from what he was doing and said \"Ummm, yeahhh\" then finally came over, no apology, no greeting. As soon as we paid he slid the glass door closed again. No \"thank you\" or \"have a good day\". There were still two hours before they closed, so it\\'s not like we came when they were trying to close. We left wondering what just happened. It was a weird experience. I\\'ll continue to look for a different distributor, which sucks because it\\'s so close to me, but I\\'d rather spend my money somewhere else. I gave it two stars instead of one because they do have a good selection of cases of beer if you want more than just a six-pack.',\n",
       " u\"Being from Illinois and in town to attend a Steelers game we needed beer.  Found out grocery stores only sell basically a 12 pack per person/visit. Nothing like Illinois where the sky's the limit. So after that education we ended up here.  Good selection of beer when you need more quantities that 2 six packs.  We stocked up on IC light and was reasonably priced.  Friendly service.  Only con is parking is scarce but that seems to be par for the course in Pittsburgh.  I would visit again if in the area.\",\n",
       " u\"I had read some mixed reviews but I honestly don't understand the negative feedback. This was our first time and we found street parking right around the corner. We made the 7:00 reservations only 2 days in advance and the place was about half full when we got there and very full by 8:00 with some folks eating at the bar. We were seated within minutes at a great table near the front window. It was nice and private so we could talk with our friends. Water and bread was on the table within minutes with drinks shortly behind. we ordered the beans and green and italian fries as appetizers, The beans and greens were good but I've had better, The italian fries, which seemed to be fries with flash fried kale and garlic with a pesto mayo were unbelievably good. I had the Del Sol pasta and it was very flavorful, though a little salty. The chicken was very moist and the sauce was very good. My husband had the cacciatore special and said the chicken was very good but they sauce could have been a bit more flavorful. The service was very good the entire night, I would like to go back, and try the pizza or flat bread.\",\n",
       " u\"Probably one of the worst places I have been to recently. I have had pasta come out of the freezer that was better prepared. $70 for a mushy rigatoni chicken dish and 2 glasses of wine (incl 20% gratuity.) service was very poor - on our table of 5 server couldn't remember what anyone had for drinks or dinner ever. You need to write down something on your pad like woman in blue del sol/cab sauv to help you, that's fine but don't come back all clueless like you had never heard us order. I won't be going back.  Seating was also poor, I had reservations and walked in before a large party, who was seated before me. Meaning I arrived at the hostess station first, and they took the party behind me before asking me my name. I was not the first, nor the last, to arrive for my party and reservation was in my name.\",\n",
       " u\"Pino's is an mid-level Italian place with a charming neighborhood atmosphere. The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price. \\n\\nThe reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience. I felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of Pino's to him beforehand. I know I'll be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner, but Pino's isn't somewhere I would take anyone I wanted to impress due to the problematic service.\",\n",
       " u\"I normally love Pinos. I'm a member of their Diners  Club, live 2 blocks away and often walk there with my dog and eat outside. They are very dog friendly. However, this evening I sat at the bar planing to order wine and dinner. While the bartender did give me a wine list, she then proceeded to ignore me, more interested in chatting it up with the couple at the end of the bar. After 5 minutes, I left. I thought the days of ignoring and disrespecting solo female diners were behind us. I went to Park Brugge where the service at the bar with Amanda is always top notch!\",\n",
       " u\"I went with ladies of Dine & Dish to Pino's in January. It was good, solid food.  It is located in the quaint neighborhood of Point Breeze. The service was a bit lacking but it got the job done.\",\n",
       " u'We had dinner and drinks tonight and it was great as usual. We have been here often, with couples, with family, and for a large family event. Service and food have always been top notch.',\n",
       " u'Had a really nice casual dinner at the bar with great wine. Great service at a nice, neighborhood place. The wild mushroom arugula flatbread was wonderful!',\n",
       " u\"Great neighborhood spot. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is awesome and the ambiance is perfect. \\n\\nWe had a great experience here. The mussels were flavorful and my steak main course was perfect. \\n\\nI totally recommend Pino's.\",\n",
       " u'One of my favorite places to eat while in Pittsburgh. If your in the shady side area or Bakery Square area this is one of the place you need to check out. Great service..great food..great people.',\n",
       " u\"OMG- the most delicious meal! We started with a calamari appetizer that my husband agrees to but never really likes and he couldn't stop asking for more. Unique and delicious and a very large portion (this is something you want to split) but so reasonably priced considering. We both had the rosemary brined chicken with a mushroom Demi glac\\xe9 and smashed potatoes. The presentation was delightful and the the FOOD WAS SO GOOD. DELICIOUS!  Chicken was sliced thinly but, yet tender and flavors melded wonderfully. To beat that was the chocolate mouse - the chef specializes in pastries and there are not words made yet to describe the desert we had. We only know we are going to be going back - many times. THANK YOU PINOS!!!!!\",\n",
       " u\"GREAT neighborhood restaurant, with charming atmosphere and awesome food!\\nOnly possible complaint could be that the Lamb Bolognese serving was a little skimpy..\\nbut that's because it was perfection!\",\n",
       " u\"We have had dinner there before and enjoyed it.  My sister and niece were in for the weekend so we decided to go again as we hadn't been for awhile.  \\n\\nService was lack luster and SLOW.  They charged us for a salad we ordered but was never delivered. They weren't full when we got there but they did fill up.  We probably waited 60 minutes for our entrees.  Our meals were mixed.  The flat bread pizza's which we had for appetizers were good.  Several of us had the seafood pasta.  It said it was a cream sauce but it was pretty watery. The shrimp and lobster was tough and I suspect frozen. Hell, I can cook frozen food at home.  The scallops were tiny.  Generally underwhelming.  Other dinners were better. We had a party of 7 and they added a 20% tip.  I understand why restaurants do this but I don't like it.  I tip 20% for adequate service but since when do you tip on the tax too?  We wont be back anytime soon.\",\n",
       " u'Some nice wine and good appetizers.  The main courses are quite pricey.',\n",
       " u\"Went for a quick dinner tonight and couldn't be happier.  I had the tuna and my son had the Carbonara pasta.  Both were excellent.  I love the neighborhood atmosphere.  The meals are pricey but very good.\",\n",
       " u\"The food was good. The pasta is made fresh. The ambiance wasn't very cozy. Even though you are packed together and the tables are small, it really didn't match the menu which is Primarily Italian. Our server was busy when we first got there so we waited patiently. However, as the dinner went on and it was only us and 2 other tables, she didn't clean off the table once, refill our drinks, got an order wrong (it drives me nuts when servers don't write orders down on paper). Again the food was delicious but everything else didn't fit.\",\n",
       " u'I am so glad my daughter, aunt and myself  took a chance and tried this restaurant. Liz the waitress was so helpful and friendly. We had great wine and delicious meals. It was also a nice touch that the Chef came to our table to meet and greet. If you love homemade pasta, you will love this restaurant. We will definitely be back!',\n",
       " u\"Can't recommend this barber highly enough.  I was in town, and walked over here.  I realized that they only take cash, but Paul Pirollo just says 'don't worry about it, bring it later'.  There were two guys waiting ahead of me.  It took a while because he does such a good job.  He was familiar with both men, and very friendly.  When he cut my hair, he took his time, and asked my opinion in a considerate way.  He detailed the edges of my hair with hot foam and a straight razor, and used some sort of eucalyptus-smelling post shave ointment. In talking to him I found out that he has been in this location for 53 years.  In all those years he has gotten damn good at his job. I told him 'I'll be right back with the money' and he said 'don't worry about it' come back with it any day'.  I did come right back with it, and gave him a $4 tip on a haircut that cost $15, but he really deserved more for this million-dollar haircut.\",\n",
       " u\"It is the best mechanic shop I have been to in Pittsburgh.  I went there every year for inspections and every time my car had a problem.  Absolutely excellent service!! The most valuable things that I have found about this shop is the honesty and great price, as other people mentioned in their reviews.  The brothers who work there are very nice and honest. They are always ready to help.  There are a couple of times when it was just a tiny problem with my car, they fixed my car without charging me, and even refused to take my tip.  They always explained to me what problem my car had, gave me recommendations, and found the least costly way to fix it.  The only thing I wish they could've done better is setting up voicemail function for their phone, as the phone doesn't work sometimes. However, they are always in the shop from Monday to Friday when I drop by, even after I get off work at night around 5.   It's not easy to find trustworthy mechanics. I feel pretty lucky.  Definitely recommend to those who are looking for a good mechanic shop in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"Bastone was able to get my car into the shop the very day I was out looking to get my car repaired. Carl, the man who assisted me, was very friendly, addressed all my concerns, and called me with an estimate before doing work (front end and alignment). Compared to the horror stories you can read online, their prices are very reasonable. I picked up my car a few hours later and the steering is tight, dead-center, and hasn't felt this good to drive since I bought it. I will definitely be returning if any other problem with my car arises. Nice work guys.\",\n",
       " u'Perfect place! I needed help today and they helped me....no charge...just asked me to do something nice for somebody else today!',\n",
       " u\"The guys at Bastone are great. Everyone is friendly and knowledgable. We've brought our car in several times for both regular service and repairs and they always work quickly and provide a solution at a reasonable price. They're always very patient when we ask lots of questions. Our car has never been in better shape thanks to Bastone.\",\n",
       " u'Never Again. \\nMy friend and I went into this Giant Eagle for a \"quick trip\" to pick up some chips and such before going to a party. Took us three minutes to find some chips. We stood in line to check out for about half an hour. It was like a window into hell. The line was for \"express,\" there was only one \"express\" line and there was only one slow checker. I will never step foot in that store again. I\\'m relatively new to the area and am told this store is referred to as \"the dirty bird.\"',\n",
       " u'As a petite, young, white female, I\\'m fearful to go here alone. I choose this giant eagle (most of the time) over the big Market District one on Center avenue because it\\'s easier to find a place to park, and you can run in and grab what you need quickly. However, I feel like I walk around with my purse clutched tightly to my side and have to watch my back. The clientele that hang out/shop here is not the greatest. There is a police officer that sits at the front of the building, which is good, that makes me feel a bit better. Most cashiers are friendly and nice. Some are very slow. The shift supervisor that hangs out around the cash registers is extremely unfriendly and often shows little disregard for her job, her employees, and customers. More than once she has yelled at me to \"move faster\" when using the self checkout, and when my self checkout lane has needed the assistance of an employee because it wasn\\'t working, she makes sure you know you\\'ve bothered her from what she was doing. I can\\'t wait to return to this Giant Eagle so I can get her name and post it on my Yelp review. Hopefully someone will get her some customer service training or etiquette classes.',\n",
       " u\"Came to this location for a quick run in and I regret it immensely.  Decided to get a Giant Eagle card since my item was on sale.  The clerk at Customer Service was so rude I took my ID back and walked away.  Her language was impossible to understand and when I didn't understand her second mumbling she yelled her question at me.  This happened twice.  They won't ever see me here again.\",\n",
       " u'I used to cut my own hair, haphazardly, with a pair of Andis clippers.  Once, due to a series of unfortunate events, I ended up needing a new passport photo the day I cut my hair.  I hadn\\'t realized quite how much of a goob I looked like.  Since I was going from free to paying for haircuts, I chose a Supercuts, and it was better than I did for myself.\\n\\nPeriodically I\\'m burned by a supercut, but what I\\'ve learned is that if you know what you want and tell the cutter how to do it, things generally turn out alright, and I\\'ve been going to this location since I moved to Pittsburgh and have never had a bad experience.\\n\\nThe Supercuts I used to go to in Boston was renovated with a spa-feel.  Mostly that meant new seating, and heated-massage chairs at the sinks where they do shampoos.  Not the case in Shadyside.  It\\'s in a stripmall, and everything is kind of dated.  The only \"spa\" treatment they have is the tea tree experience: you get a bit of a hot towel face massage and special tingly tea tree shampoo.  Some of the cutters will spend several minutes on this, while others finish so fast it seems like they have an aversion to scalp-contact.  It\\'s hit or miss in terms of the amount of time they spend, but for $5 that\\'s a risk I\\'m willing to take.  Of course you can do the same for yourself with a little Dr. Bronner\\'s, but after letting someone operate sharp machinery near my face, sometimes I want to be pampered just a bit.\\n\\nSo far, while some have been better than others, I\\'ve never had an embarrassing cut at this location, and if you\\'re a dude with short hair, you can be in and out during your lunch break at work for $30 (or about $20 if you don\\'t want the shampoo).',\n",
       " u\"Great results, great people, great customer service. I've brought my car in to this shop three times, and my husband has used it once. They do excellent, honest work here and are so friendly and knowledgeable that I know I can come in for car body advice at any time. I wish I could give them more business, but I'm leaving the state. Will miss this place. Never thought I'd say that about a body shop.\",\n",
       " u\"Super nice guys. They ended up doing a number of simple things for free and they're not afraid of complex jobs. If you need help with your door hinges, come here.\",\n",
       " u'Worst in Pittsburgh. Just got the MooGooGai Pan with Hot/sour soup which is one of my regulars. I read on here that they have a $10 minimum so I ordered some fried wontons to make up the difference. I was charged $14 because I didn\\'t say \"lunch special\" when the size I was given was obviously lunch sized. The wontons were horrible dry crackers with a marble sized price of \"meat\" inside. No dipping sauce with the wontons. Hot/soup was bland was so small I thought it was my dipping sauce. Opened up my Moo Goo and it was mostly broccoli and zucchini. Almost no chicken. Got an extra fortune cookie though!\\nI will not be eating here again. Total disappointment.',\n",
       " u'I wish there was a zero star option to give. This may be some of the worst \"Chinese\" I\\'ve ever been delivered. First off, everything was dripping everywhere. The entire bag was a soggy mess. Then we get to the chicken chow mein. I\\'m not even sure they bothered to cook that. My boyfriend couldn\\'t even look at it once taking a bite, it made him sick. Next up, the \"general tso\\'s bean curd.\" Under cooked and not properly drained of any water. I don\\'t know what that sauce was made from but it was disgracing all General Tso\\'s sauce by existing. The egg rolls, a Chinese classic, were so dark and hard, I\\'m not sure how we could have possibly eaten them. The Crab Rangoon\\'s... Generally these are my favorite thing at a Chinese restaurant. I\\'m not sure what they think they are attempting to pass for Crab Rangoon\\'s here. These monstrosities were completely inedible. \\n\\nThe only thing they didn\\'t mess up on our order was the rice. It tasted and looked like rice. When we called to complain I was told the restaurant said they did nothing wrong and wouldn\\'t do anything about the situation. Awesome. Now my stomach is upset from the few bites I took.\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure this place should change it\\'s name to \"Inedible Slop\" because it\\'s far from \"Tasty.\"',\n",
       " u\"This is a little Hong Kong restaurant gem in Shadyside.But first a disclaimer, if your idea of classic Chinese food runs to General Tso or Kung Pau chicken, chow mein, egg rolls or (perish the thought ) crab Rangoon then this place is really not for you Although much of the business this place does is takeout/ delivery of the type of American Chinese dishes I mentioned above the Forte of Tasty Chinese restaurant is real Hong Kong style food . Unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the American version  of Chinese food.The first time I came to this place they only gave me the American iced menu.But having lived in the Bay Area for many years I scoped out the Hong Kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time I went to Tasty and I did.Now I just  pick up the Hong Kong menu automatically when I come in.Their Hong Kong dishes are some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.The garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouth.The salted squid (what's usually known as salt and pepper squid) has a light, crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid is\\njust a tiny bit chewy but not too much so.Texture in squid is a daunting thing to get just right.I am a Chow Fun freak anyway  but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best I've ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce . Recently I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and took him here (kind of a test to see if my view of this place was somehow off) and he raved about everything especially this chow fun dish.To sum up,if you want to experience the best of Tasty please order from the Hong Kong menu.Since. I don't order American Chinese dishes here I can't comment on them but I guess the genius of this place is authentic South Chinese dishes (as evidenced by the Chinese families I've seen eating here) not the usual  pseudo Chinese dishes many people seem to order here.I expect the chef/cook here just doesn't have his heart in Crab Rangoon or chow mein.\",\n",
       " u\"Eating as I type. First time ordering here. \\n\\nCrab Rangoon - cooked to perfection. Downfall is there is barely anything stuffed inside. You don't taste a thing. Biggest disappointment.\\n\\nFried rice - average. It's rice. No sign of egg just a lot of onion. Not bad though. \\n\\nGeneral tso's - pretty good. It's spicy like I requested. Sauce was all at the bottom, just needed a stir. Chicken was cooked nearly perfect, some a little chewy but better than the normal weird and slimy chicken you get. Sauce is really good. \\n\\nOrdered via eat street and took about 20 mins to be delivered to Bloomfield. Pretty fast. \\n\\nI'd order again. Definitely wouldn't try the Rangoon again. And that's one of my favorite apps.\",\n",

My mom, uncles, aunts and even grandparents would grab a bite here ever since I can remember. \\nOn a trip home, pregnant and all, I went to visit and was extremely disappointed. I ordered a chicken salad,  picked it up, drove 15 mins to my family home only to discover that there was NO chicken in my chicken salad!!! Wtf. When I called, the guy who answered was already anticipating my call,  I assume because before I could explain to him the error,  he stated \"yup!\" and pretty much ended the call. I debated for several moments whether or not to return, but my little one made the decision for me. When I returned,  I thought I\\'d at least be offered a pop for my troubles,  or even a hear felt apology for the inconvenience...nope. My chicken was placed on top of the salad and the young girl at the register offered me an additional ranch dressing, for my trouble.  \"Wow\" is all I could muster up. What happened to the Ventos that was once nestled between Fox\\'s bar and the cleaners, in front of Sears...or the one on the corner,  across from that single apartment building? Now, like everything else in East Liberty, this once regarded community staple is quickly transitioning to the gentrified community of tomorrow,  all fluff and no substance. Out with the old (school), in with the new, literally.  I hate that ish...',\n",
       " u\"Worst pizza I have had in my entire 40 years of life. Tasted like sauce and cheese on toast. Frozen pizza is better than their pizza. I wouldn't eat this pizza if it was free.\",\n",
       " u\"It's clear that this business just does not have pride about where they are who they are. They are here to make money. It's frustrating because they also don't particularly need to work hard. There are not a lot of other gas stations in the area particularly ones that have car washes. I come here to fill up for the week and by getting a car wash I save money on my gas. They have me here for the savings. \\n\\nThe guy behind the counter claimed he wasn't hungover he just had too much benadryl. It's clear they have the perfect people to work at a gas station. Perhaps he shouldn't be here during the Saturday morning rush however.\",\n",
       " u\"I like this place. Its rarely as busy as the GetGo, doesn't play stupid grocery-store point pricing games, they have Diesel now, and a pretty decent automatic car wash that is priced just right. Its also conveniently on the right side of the road when I'm heading westbound on Baum.\\n\\nOther than that, its just a gas station. But, hey, at least I can clean my car here.\",\n",
       " u\"Be careful paying with cash here. I coughed up the $12 cash I had in my pocket, went out to the pump. After attempting to pump gas, and getting maybe a pint, it just stopped working. I had to wait in line again to get to the counter. After waiting, they told me it had pumped. We went round and round, with their solution being that they could print me a receipt, and I could come talk to the manager about it. This was %100 unacceptable, but there wasn't much to do about it in the face of their utter indifference. Zero effort, and a horrible attitude. I've had a history of not great experiences here, and that's saying a lot. It's a gas station, how hard can it be? It's clear that they do not care at all. This past incident just seals it. I'm never going back, and you shouldn't either.\",\n",
       " u\"Had a great experience at Mikes. I backing into a loading dock, which completely shattered my taillight and dented my side panel. I'm a college student so naturally I was very upset and worried to see how much it would cost. They made me feel comfortable and gave me a great price for the repair which only took a couple of hours! Definitely would go back again.\",\n",
       " u'They did a  fantastic job on my car. I did not go through insurance so of course it cost more than I was hoping. Also my car was in the shop an extra day or two than expected. But DO NOT GET ME WRONG they do quality work, fair price, and Paul and both of the receptionists I spoke with, are as friendly as can be. They even fixed things that a different body shop in Texas messed up on; Mikes body shop fixed their mistake for under $12. I highly recommend them to anyone. Even tho they are not in the best of neighborhoods, they do quality work for a reasonable price and they even wash, vacuum and buff your car for free. \\n\\nPs- they warranty all of their work the entire time you own your vehicle',\n",
       " u\"Hands down one of the most friendliest and honest body shop around. They look me square in the eyes and told me what was up with my vehicle. I was hit by another individual and their insurance company told me to come here. They are highly regarded in the BBB and I know why. They even washed and polished my car inside and out. Only reason I didn't give it a five was that enterprise was the one who contacted me about my car...and that was because they wanted theirs back. Otherwise, go here!\",\n",
       " u'Like all the other Yelpers- I took my car here for the convenience and because they were listed as approved by my insurance...I will never take my car anywhere else now for body work!\\n\\nThey are a very honest shop and they do quality work!

Paul went through and found the cheapest solution possible for me, knowing I was self pay. \\n\\nThanks to all there!',\n",
       " u\"I took my car here after a pretty nasty fender bender I was involved in. I initially came here because they were approved and recommended by my insurance carrier, GEICO. All I can say is how over the top impressed I was with the entire operation. First off the area I was greeted in was VERY clean and welcoming. I was treated promptly and respectfully by the staff. Given a realistic quote, including some extra work I wanted to have done while the car was being worked on. I know some people on here have complained about the work taking extra time, but mine was done a little sooner than anticipated. It was the morning of instead of end of the day quoted, but I'll take it. The car looked amazing too. The work was absolutely top notch.\\n\\nThe kicker for me though was I did not have rental policy on my insurance, so Mike's provided me with a loaner car for the duration of the repairs. What AMAZING customer service. I can't recommend these guys highly enough.\",\n",
       " u\"They are a pretty good place. They do the best they can with the limited funding they have. The employees definitely love the animals and want what is best for them.\\n\\nWe adopted a cat from this location over a year ago, and while it turned out okay (we still have the cat), I was surprised to learn from our vet that the cat we adopted was feral--you'd think that would have been an important bit of information to share with the adopting family, especially when there's a child in the house!\",\n",
       " u\"Everyone I have encountered here is amazing. You can tell they are passionate and dedicated when it comes to their job. I adopted a kitten here at the end of the summer and she is absolutely perfect. You can tell that she was loved & cared for while in their care. \\n\\nI took her for a 6 month check up recently and the vet was so nice. He took time to look over her and was genuinely kind to me and my mom. Sometimes people who work with animals lose their people skills, but this guy was great. It's waaaaay out of my way, but I'd definitely take Lily back there for any problems that arise. Well worth the drive.\",\n",
       " u\"We took our kitty here to get spayed at the east liberty location.  Although they accomplished the job for a very reasonable price they were just extremely rude.  I know that you're probably not making much working here receptionist ladies but just try to be nice.\",\n",
       " u'They did my dogs neutering surgery and they did not do it correctly, which resulted in it opening the next day. The listed emergency number did not answer and when I did get ahold of them I was immediately told it would be at least $160 to have him seen. I had to take him somewhere else get him seen and then back to the animal rescue league to it done right. My poor baby went through hell. Never again will I take my dog there.',\n",
       " u'Although I aplaud the Western Pennsylvania Animal Rescue League for the services they provide including their Vaccine Clinic, I\\'m VERY dissapointed by the preferential treatment given to some individuals. \\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with the vaccine clinic, it is first come, first serve. Many of us get here more than an hour before the clinic starts and wait in line. For those of us who have not as well behaved animals, we tag team it and have one person stand in line while the other stays somewhere off to the side with the animal.\\n\\nHowever, on the July Clinic, one lady claimed to be first because she told a volunteer that she needed to stay in the car with her mom instead of waiting in line. Then when the paperwork was being passed out and those of us in line expressed the fact that she did not stand in line, some of us even having a picture of those of us in line, she repeated the fact that she has an elderly mom. When that didn\\'t suffice, she said she had an agressive dog. While I understand that agressive dogs should not be in close proximity to other animals or humans which they could harm, that doesnt stop others who have less friendly animals to still stand in line and control our pets or have another member of the family stand in line on our behalf. For the ARL to let both individuals and their \"agressive\" dog sit in the car and be taken first is unfair to the rest of the participants. What is even more concerning is that this \"agressive\" dog was allowed to sit in the waiting room for 21 minutes with 10 other owners and their pets, some of us which had more than one pet. If this truely was a case of an agressive animal, then the ARL did a disservice to its first 10 Vaccine Clinic participants who were in the waiting room. In addition, the release form states that agressive animals will not be tollerated. \\n\\nIt would be one thing if this was a one off, but then someone came in claiming to have an apt for a vaccine booster at 930 even though they don\\'t schedule appointments on Sundays except for SPAY day, and they took him!\\n\\nIf any one knows what I need to do or say to get preferential treatment in the future, please let me know! I get that this is a low cost clinic where the services are provided at cost and I greatly appreciate  that because it helps me care for my animals and the rescues we have at a reasonable cost. However, I shouldn\\'t be punished or forced to wait because others cannot follow directions. It would have been a different story if the preferential treatment was because of medical emergency, but they won\\'t.\\n\\nARL, please keep up the great services you provide, but also please be mindful of ALL of your patients.\\n\\nThanks,\\nA loving pet owner.',\n",
       " u\"We recently lost our beloved cat, and our hearts are still broken. I couldn't stand our house without a cat, so I begged my husband to go look at kittens. We knew we wanted a shelter cat, so we went to the ARL. \\nIt was a wonderful experience. The volunteers were very helpful. We were holding kittens in the kitten room, but the one we seemed to really like was very nervous. They allowed us to take her into another room, and checked on us numerous times.\\nThey were extremely busy and short-staffed, but efforts were still made to make sure we were able to bond with the kitten. They weren't pushy, and they were very patient.\\n\\nOnce we made our decision to adopt, they whisked us over to the main building. The whole process took about 20 minutes. The staff really cares about the well being of their animals. It's great place!\",\n",
       " u'There are a bunch of pretentious self ritiuos self entitled ass clowns. The pious smiles on those stupid faces was only topped how they were too busy to find my dogs stollen colllar. I left my dog in my car for less then 30 minutes, in the shade with the windows down and some strumpet called 911 and animal control takes my dog to this \"shelter\" who then charged me $90 to get her back, on top of losing her colar. Then they treat me I\\'m a villian because the reporting woman said the dog wasin the car in the sun with the windows up for over 2 hours. I guess they trust total freak show losers more than their owners.\\n\\nI literally rescued this dog from the woods in Texas (a kill on site state), she was 12 lb, starving, scared, and looked like a skeleton. She was sick six ways to sunday. I spent $2000 dollars getting her healthy, and got kick out of my apartment which didn\\'t allow pets. Then spent another $1000 dollars when she got a punchured lung at a dog park . This, all for a dog I found in the woods. Do you really thing I\\'m going to lock it in a car to die? Am I really a villian? The crew at that \"shelter\" need to check their attitudes before treating people like Michael Vick.\\n\\n\\nOH YEA! When I asked if there was another option besides paying this outrageous bill, the uncaring bearded rope-pusher casually said \"we euthanize, or put up for adoption, yours we would euthanize\".... I hate that place and everyone in it.',\n",
       " u\"I'm all for what the Animal Rescue League does.  My parents just adopted the most precious 5 year old dog from the ARL, but the management here REALLY needs to pull it together.  The volunteers and staff are great, but there are just a lot of issues.\\n\\nFirst, my parents love their little seven pound dog, but getting a small dog here is exceptionally difficult.  You need to be prepared to go in at opening and take the dog home that day.  They will only place a 24 hours hold on the animal, and many people coming in here want small dogs.  There was a LOT of heartbreak before finally landing a dog.\\n\\nSecond, there seems to be a lot of oversights.  My parents' dog wasn't properly vaccinated, which is really concerning.  The poor baby had really severe kennel cough as well, and he was sick for well over two weeks after adoption.  They had balls and things in the playrooms that the dogs share, which spreads disease.  :(\\n\\nI think with some proper training and/or change, this place could fulfill its mission even better.  The good news is that after looking at their 990s, they seem to have successful financial management so this is easily possible.  Well... unless you count the fact that they haven't turned a 990 in the IRS in 2 years according to GuideStar.\\n\\nMaybe they just need some stronger management.\",\n",
       " u\"The Animal Rescue League is simply the friendliest, most human and pet friendly shelter in the city. I cannot thank them enough for allowing me to adopt my new little buddy. \\n\\nI was able to meet and greet with the cat that I was looking to adopt, and spend some time with him in a secluded play area. His foster was there to ask some questions about what I was looking for in a cat and if I had any experience with cat care. All pretty standard for what you should expect before rescuing a new family member. \\n\\nThe adoption process was super easy, the paperwork was standard and nothing intrusive or out of the ordinary. The adoption counselors were very thorough with the paperwork and answered any and all questions I had about my kitty's health and history. And all-in-all, I was able to take him home the same day I filled out the paperwork. \\n\\nThis place is great and takes wonderful care of their animals. I would highly recommend them be your first stop for adopting. \\n\\nScore out of Five: \\nFriendliness: Five stars!\\nCustomer Service: Five stars!\\nEase of Adoption Process: Five stars!\\n\\nWould I ever recommend them? Absolutely!\",\n",

I highly recommend this place.',\n",
       " u\"This guy isn't a tailor. He's a butcher. Seriously, . . . I brought in two suits. I got them back two weeks and $250 later. The pants were an solid inch short of the top of my shoes! I've had twenty or more suits professionally tailored in the course of my career and I've never said anything other than 'generous break'.  The pants fit on the middle of my hips and the crotch fit like a bad bicycle seat. The coat had the oddest roll I've ever seen, diagonal from shoulder to waist. It was SO BAD that I didn't even take it back to complain as lacked any confidence whatsoever that he could fix it. Took everything across town and for less than $30 they were able to work with the pants. But there was not enough fabric left in the coat to offer any help. Bad. Really bad.\",\n",

       " u\"Great work and excellent customer service. With our extended training in DC, we've been out of town a lot and so only had July 4th weekend to do the emissions test and state inspection on our car. \\n\\nI called for an appointment, dropped the car off by 9am Saturday (July 4th) and it was ready by noon! Thanks to Kayla, Craig and the entire team at Good Year for fitting us in. I really appreciated them getting this done for us so quickly, not to mention the fact that they worked a full day on a national holiday.\",\n",
       " u\"I went in for new tires and a routine oil change. When I called about my car's status after many hours, I was told that the machine they use to pump the oil malfunctioned and motor oil got all over my car's engine! They said it shouldn't be a problem since they cleaned the engine bay, but when they brought my car out, my check engine light was on. They went to clear the light, but it came back on again. I was told to bring my car in the next day and they will look into the problem. On my way home, my engine started smoking profusely. Since my check engine light was on, I stopped at a local garage to get it checked out. They looked at my engine for me and told me that Goodyear must have spilled a TON of motor oil on my engine which caused it to smoke like crazy. The mechanic also pulled up the check engine light code (Goodyear did not tell me when I asked them about the code when I picked up my car), which said that my oxygen sensor was malfunctioning. The oxygen sensor in my car is connected right to the exhaust manifold and it was clear from visual inspection that oil has gotten all over it.\\n\\nI went back to Goodyear the next day, they took my car in and I waited for over an hour in their lounge. No one came out to tell me what they were doing to fix my car or if they were taking responsibility for the faulty sensor. I finally had to asked the desk clerk, who told me that they were going to replace the sensor and I should come back later. Goodyear did replace the oxygen sensor free of charge. They never apologized for the oil spill; no one talked me through what they were doing during the repair. I will not be returning in the future.\",\n",

       " u'Some things are a blessing in disguise--such as the time I attempted to relocate to Pittsburgh and found a somewhat decent apartment in the North Side.  I took a tour of the place.  I was hopeful the cat smell would be addressed but when the guy said \"Oh, you can smell that?\" I should have known then.  The apartment needed painted--badly, but I was willing to deal so that the stress of relocation could go away.  The unit also had no window treatments, no air conditioning, and did I mention the cat smells?  \\n\\nOn a Friday, I told them I was interested in the apartment, they told me to mail my security deposit check that day.  I followed direction and mailed it.  I made plans for moving.  They never called to tell me my rent check wasn\\'t recieved on Saturday or the following Monday.  I had to email them to request a copy of my lease when I was told  \"The apartment is no longer available, someone came in today and gave a security deposit\".  Interesting--so when I asked the office that past Friday they told me not to bring in my check--that mail would suffice.  Something doesn\\'t sound right here.  Their lack of communication also cost me an additional $100 in non-refundable moving expenses as I had put down a deposit with a moving company.  \\n\\nDefinately one of the more frustrating things to happen to me during my relocation, but based off the condition the apartment was in, coupled with these poor reviews, I should be counting my blessings.',\n",
       " u\"Refuge from the snowstorm, kind service, just wish it were a bit quicker.  My husband got a shot in the dark coffee, I got a yummy goddess tea, and those were great. The service was excellent and the patrons working away on their laptops gave off a good vibe. I definitely want to come back and get some work done here.  We had a great chat to the barista. The mushroom panini sandwiches took a bit long to get, even though there wasn't a rush lunch crowd. The mushrooms were cold, I think Id prefer them warmer? - the side salad was great.\",\n",
       " u\"Tazza, you slippin! When I first came to Pittsburgh, this place was a solid five star coffee joint not as good as I remember. Still in the top tier of Pittsburgh coffee shops but not even a contender for best anymore. Vegan apple cinnamon donuts were great but steamed milk on latte was less wonderful than I remember. Brownies: Still a real surperative. But damn, when I'm going to a place like this, for me it's all about the steamed milk.\",\n",
       " u'best in pittsburgh, hands down!!!!',\n",
       " u'Saw this place listed on a blog--and had to come here. We had tea and cappuccino. It was delicious- but my favorite thing is the neighborhood and the outdoor seating. Great for a coffee date',\n",
       " u\"My mission before graduating is to try all the independent coffee shops in Pittsburgh. Tazza D'oro came highly recommended from my friend and I didn't need any reason to go to any coffee shop. My girlfriend and I stopped in to grab some lattes and catch up. We also decided to get their baked goods. I never had a mocha that was so smooth and I loved my chocolate croissant. The noise level was relatively quiet and it may become my new study place. I will definitely be coming back for more of their coffee!\",\n",
       " u\"Let me preface this by saying I am one of those bizarre people who does not like coffee. Given that, I consider it a testament to how absolutely wonderful Tazza D'oro is, because one sip of my friend's mocha and I was in silky, smooth heaven. I ordered the hot chocolate, which was every bit as rich and creamy as a hot chocolate should be. \\n\\nOn to the food - don't come here if you expect a wide selection of bites to pair with your drink. They only had a few options, but from what I could tell, each one was crafted with love, skill, and just the right amount of sugar. I had a fruit tart (berries and strawberries), which was a delightful combination of tangy and sweet. My friend had a very satisfying chocolate croissant - but to be fair, it's difficult to make a chocolate croissant anything but. I was so impressed that I took home an apple puff pastry and vowed to return posthaste. \\n\\nThis is precisely the sort of place in which Elizabeth Bennet would while away a dreary day, were coffee shops accessible in rural, Georgian England. I wouldn't suggest coming with a large group; neither the limited seating nor the ambience is conducive to that.  It's quiet and intimate - ideal to catch up with friends or bury your nose in a book.\",\n",
       " u\"This is one of those places I really want to love. You walk in, it is super cute, nice ambiance, friendly staff, people are reading and talking... None of these are bad things. I got a regular coffee black and a sandwich, which came close to $15. A little pricey but whatever. The sandwich was just gross. Old bread that was just past stale to the gummy gross stage, almost no toppings and some weird spread (it was the mushroom sandwich). The coffee was just a little off. I couldn't put my finger on why, but it didn't seem right. Then I looked into the back room.... There is bread stacked EVERYWHERE. No wonder mine was stale. I might go back for coffee in a pinch, but I wouldn't get food there again.\",\n",
       " u\"I don't drink coffee, so keep moving if that's what you care about. Surprisingly quiet (library quiet) coffee shop, which is nice unless you're hoping to have a conversation without the looming self-consciousness of being overheard. Surprisingly cheap iced/chilled tea. There was a large group of neighbors gathering at the outside tables, and a fair amount of passing conversation, which suggests this might be a community gathering spot for Highland Park residents. Hoping to be inspired in future visits.\",\n",
       " u'Counter culture brand coffee is exceptional! Herbal, green and other tea choices are amazing. Foods: my least favorite is the portobello sandwich. . Great location and ambiance.',\n",

       " u\"Cute little shop! I take my daughter here after school sometimes for a green tea and a snack. Everything is delicious, we've never been dissatisfied. The staff is very friendly as well! My favorite coffee/tea place in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"I used to be all about this place before I moved to New York, so I was excited this morning when I decided to get coffee for my girlfriend and I. \\n\\nSeriously, fuck this place. I came in, and everyone gave me the once over, and I get the brooding barista act, but as a patron and someone who has worked in the service industry, I feel like there definitely should be some sort humanesque emotion displayed from these people. All three behind the counter looked at me like I had ten eyes and dicks for eyebrows. \\n\\nI asked for Iced Skim Latte, got a hot one, but hey, small fuck up. It was the exasperated sigh when I corrected them, I could've fucking done without. Still didn't get an iced skim latte. \\n\\nAlso, when I point to something and use the proper name of it, I feel like it shouldn't be a problem for an individual of average intelligence. I ordered an apple dumpling, pointed to the apple dumpling, and thought I was watching them put it in there, until I turned my head for a second, and got a fucking Danish. It wouldn't have been a big fucking deal, IF THEY WERENT FUCKING DICKS THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS THERE. \\n\\nYeah, five out of five stars, definitely gonna go again and right my next screenplay.\",\n",
       " u\"Now that's a nice latte. One of the better lattes I've had. I'd highly recommend it. I only got it to go, so I can't comment on much else. But I'd recommend it. Parking is a pain.\",\n",

Not only do they provide a whole range of classes at no extra charge with membership, but they go the extra mile with those who really work it. \\n\\n I find it impossible to have the stamina for everydaylife's marathons of apartment and job searches, bureaucratic runarounds, and even having a social life when I am significantly overweight (carrying an extra 40 pounds). I know that each time I lose the weight, I swear never again, but life interferes with my healthy routines, and stress, upheaval, desperation and disappointments kick in with cortisol and bellyfat. Suddenly, I am looking at myself, angry and miserable - a fat suit in a mirror, berating myself for letting my latest heart and soul effort put my heart at risk and my soul that much closer to G-d (but not in a good way). In this moment, I am grateful that Club 1 is there, that they take my insurance, that their staff are willing to match the effort I put in to help me get back on track. Just knowing, in that moment, that they are there, empowers me, gives me hope - the strength to overcome procrastination and fatigue to make that next right choice -just get there - even for 5 minutes. More the next time. Thanks everybody!\",\n",

Those who are rating this place a 1-star need to take out that stick up their asses and take their hate elsewhere. Every time I've been here, there's great service and food was good (not 5 star). True, wings are overpriced but then Wednesdays they have all you can eat. Their fries and desserts are good. Service, despite a Patriots game on, was great.\",\n",
       " u'I love this place. I been going here for years. I loved the BBQ sauce when it was used at the old Hot Licks in Shadyside and later The Motor Square Gardens.

       " u\"Decided to grab a drink and a quick dinner with my ball n' chain at the bar.  I ordered the half n' half combo of soup and sandwich (grilled cheese and tomato soup).  The Husband had the grilled chicken sammie.  As soon as the kitchen dumped out my order the bartender immediately took issue with the portion size.  It was much appreciated.  He immediately went back and got me more food.  Regardless of how good the service, the food was not worth coming for.  The soup was the consistency of the stuff in the canned soup that they instruct you to add water to prior to heating (minus the whole adding water step).  As a result, it was as thick as a dip.  Despite not being soup, it made a great dip for the potato chips.  Sit at the bar.\",\n",

Unfortunately every time I wish I was somewhere else.\\n\\nTheir claim to fame should be their wings, but they are consistently some of the worst in Pittsburgh. The sauces are forgettable, they consistently come out cold, and they cost $11 for 10 (forgetting wing night obviously). You'd think that you could at least wash it down with a cold beer but whatever room they keep their kegs in must just have a window unit air conditioner.\\n\\nService is normally fine, but the place is always dirty and hot as hell.

I'm a big fan of their crab rangoons; there's lots of filling in them compared to the rangoons from other places. The sauce and meat in my meals isn't as flavorful as other Chinese take-outs have been, but it's still tasty. And my experience with the staff has been fine. Also FYI, it's cash only, and there's an ATM right outside by the door. I've never eaten in (there's a few tables) or in the buffet that's attached next door, so I can't speak on that.

For us, that pet is our cat, Nicholas, and that hard to find treat is the dehydrated chicken treats he loves. What I love is that but everything they have is a quality product.

       " u\"Even though I work nearby, there are several auto repair shops in the area so what drew me to Walter's was the fantastic reviews on Yelp, and I agree, and am a very satisfied customer.  They were able to squeeze me in for my past-due yearly inspection after my dealership was unable to keep my scheduled appointment last Saturday due to a power outage.  I dropped the car off before work and was able to pick it up easily.  They were attentive, friendly, and fair-priced - I plan on using them again not only for my yearly inspection but for my regular car maintenance.\",\n",

But I had been told by a dealer in the North Hills (in retrospect, incorrectly) that it wouldn't be covered, so I left it with Walter.\\n\\nHe diagnosed the problem as the seat belt buckle, called Shadyside Honda with my car's VIN, and Shadyside confirmed that the part *was* under warranty.  Walter then called me and suggested I take it there.  And he refused to charge me anything, even after two offers to pay.\\n\\nSo, in terms of honesty and willingness to really go beyond what a customer would expect, Walter's automotive gets top ratings!\",\n",
       " u\"I used this shop in order to perform my annual inspection. They were extremely flexible with me being from out of state and my busy schedule.

But I figured that it was probably lost forever or had been stolen.\\n\\nToday (a day after I called) the mechanic at Walter's called me back and told me that he'd found the ring. \\n\\nNot only did the staff there humor me and look for something that I figured lost forever, but they found it and returned it!\\n\\nThanks so much for being not just great mechanics, but great human beings too, Walter's staff!\",\n",

He just gets the job done and sends me on my way normally with in the day. This is a place you can trust and if he has an opening he will take you.',\n",
       " u\"Great service, friendly people. I have been taking my car to Walter's for over two years now. \\nFour months back, I got my wheel bearing and hub changed in my 97 Accord. But when the noise came back recently, Tim replaced the hub without costing much.\\nHonest would be the right word to describe the people at Walter's automotive.\",\n",
       " u'Prices are reasonable and they have not given me the \"I am here to screw you out of a bunch of money\" feeling you get from dealerships and other automobile garages.  I will continue to use this place.  They are very knowlegable when it comes to fixing vehicles.',\n",
       " u'This man is the real deal, a great mechanic, funny guy, and honest businessman. I was fearing the worst for my car after pep boys gave me a very high price to fix my cooling fan and miscommunicated vital info about the repair, prompting my earlier negative review. It took awhile to complete the repair as Tim told me two other cooling fans they tried to put in were also faulty. They finally got a third one in that worked, and charged me only for the parts and labor to put that fan in, which ended up being hundreds less than Pep Boys. Plenty of places could have tacked on a lot of extra labor costs for changing out those failed fans. I was blown away by the good experience I had, even if it took awhile and a couple fans to get right. Tim has won a loyal customer with that kind of service.',\n",
       " u\"The staff at Walter's treated me like an old friend even though this was my first time there. Everyone was so nice, the prices are unbelievable & I will definitely bring my car here for any services it needs!\",\n",

       " u'Probably unnecessary for me to add another 5 star review to this page... But I just can\\'t help it.\\n\\nCalled in because I noticed a strange problem with my car that was only perceptible after driving it around for a while. They told me to bring the car in for a road test the next day. When I went in, I mentioned that the car was still under warranty but the dealership wanted to charge me $150 for a \"diagnostic\" before they could determine whether or not (a) there was actually a problem and (b) it was covered by my warranty. After driving around with me for about 20 minutes, Tim determined that there was definitely something strange going on... and then told me to take it back to the dealership and tell them that I had driven the car with a local mechanic and that there was clearly something wrong that should be covered by my warranty. \\n\\nHow much was I charged for this? Not. One. Dime. Such a pleasure to receive great service while also being treated with kindness and respect. Would recommend this place to anybody in a heartbeat.',\n",
       " u\"Something I look for in car repair shops is accurate diagnosis, and I was not disappointed when I went to Walter's.  My car was screeching incessantly when I drove and turned.  It was so loud that I was worried that something was very wrong so I decided to get it checked out.  Walter took a look at my car and found that the problem was not serious, and he fixed the source of the noise with a screwdriver.  I drove away in minutes.  It was a good experience, and I would go back for other services.\",\n",
       " u\"Walters automotive has never disappointed me. I was quoted almost double what Walters charged me for replacement brakes and rotors. I'm so thankful that I held out to go to Walters and get the fair price.\",\n",
       " u\"Had my emissions inspection done here today. Tim is awesome. He has a sense of humor, is personable, and professional. I don't know much about mechanics, and when I asked him some questions, he explained it to me in laymen's terms without patronizing. He gave me advice on how I could make things go faster next year on their part. It was great. \\n\\nI was a little nervous about seeing a new mechanic for my car because I'm a young woman and we can be discriminated against in the mechanical world. But my friend recommended Walter's and I am so glad. Fast, efficient service.\",\n",
       " u'Had my front brakes replaced on my 2000 4Runner (rotors had gotten warped).  Also got an oil change.  Tim was awesome, had great stories and a funny guy.  Really great service here - definitely the place to go to.',\n",
       " u\"Seems like a decent garage. I was really in a jam and needed a repair done and had already bought the needed part. However they would not install it. I'm not sure why their policy is this way perhaps there's good reasoning behind it but it left me in a jam. Most garages mark up parts 40% maybe that's why? Or maybe they don't want everyone walking in the door with their own parts? I wasn't expecting a warranty I just wanted to part put on the car\",\n",
       " u\"I had my car inspected 2 weeks ago and it was a pleasure to deal with Walter's. They called me when they told me they would, and there were no surprises. It is so rare these days that you discover  a business so honest and so diligent. I would recommend Walter's to everybody;  however,  I'm worried I won't get an appt next year!\",\n",
       " u'It\\'s hard enough finding a good mechanic period. But to find one that\\'s friendly and reasonably priced is unheard of. I\\'ve been loyal to Tim for the last 4 years and he\\'s never let me down. If there\\'s one complaint it\\'s that things can sometimes take a little longer than expected, but this is a minuscule \"con\" in an ocean of \"pros.\" At one time, I needed a new flex pipe put on my exhaust, Tim recommended that I go to a neighboring shop to get the exhaust work done because \"it would be too expensive if I did it.\" This was something I\\'ve never encountered. A mechanic recommending another place to do business??? Do yourself a favor and give this place your business. Your car might be out of commission for a few days, but the comfort of knowing you\\'re not being swindled is absolutely worth it.',\n",
       " u\"Not that these guys need another 5 star review, but here I am.  Super nice folks. They are accommodating, knowledgeable, affordable, and fast.  I'm new to the area and went here based solely on yelp reviews. I hate dealing with mechanics but Walters was refreshingly painless.\",\n",
       " u\"Recently took our car to Walter's for a state inspection. Could not be more pleased with the service provided by Tim and his staff. Time went above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of. I will be going back to Walter's for all of my auto mechanic needs.\",\n",
       " u\"Not cheap by any means.  Rather expensive for the most part. Others rave about this guy, but honestly, I don't really see what makes him that great! He charges just like any other mechanics...parts are marked up just like everyone else. It is not like one can barter with what the prices a mechanic charges; otherwise you can't get the car back.\",\n",
       " u\"Interesting theater.  Upon entering, the lobby is decorative and enticing.  It makes you want to see the inside of the theater for more ornamentation.  Alas, the actual theater section doesn't look anything like the entrance or lobby.  Its walls are dark, as if darkened on purpose with no detail, no features.  Just confused by this stark contrast, that's all.\\n\\nHistory per its website and Wikipedia indicate it originally was a silent movie theater called the Regent Theatre in 1914.  It went through some periods of being open and closed and renovated.  It most recently re-opened as the Kelly Strayhorn Theater in 2002, named after Pittsburgh's own dancer Gene Kelly and composer Billy Strayhorn.  It's a nice quaint size seating 350 and the seats are comfortable enough with enough space for the knees.\\n\\nOn this particular night, we had tickets to see The Chamber Music Pittsburgh's Pablo Villegas with free tickets won from WYEP radio station.  Mr. Villegas is a Spanish classical guitarist and this venue was just the right size in which to enjoy his performance.  The sound system was superb.\",\n",

I told them I would not be renting from them (mind you I never signed a lease or any kind of documentation) and that I wanted my deposit back. They said they would return it however I would be charged an inconvenience fee.. Meanwhile I was the one who was being inconvenienced. Another week passed And I heard not a word from anyone in the office. I finally ending up going into the office and demanding my deposit back.

I've had pecan pie, key lime pie, lilac cake (which is basically the best white cake you'll ever have), broccoli/cheese & mushroom quiches, biscuits, coconut cream pie. The crusts are exquisite, too.

She said that they were incredible but that they sold out really quickly after the store opened. We happened to walk past the store at 10:15 AM (the store opened at 10 that day), so we decided to try our luck. We arrived just in time, and we managed to snag the very last cinnamon roll (at least at the moment; maybe they make more later, but I'm not sure). We also got three macarons: one blue velvet, one PB&J, and one salted caramel. All of these items totaled to $9, which I think it a pretty good deal. \\n\\nThe cinnamon roll was outstanding. It was soft, buttery, and perfectly sweet. All of the macarons were top notch too. They had thin, crispy shells with a chewy inside and subtle but still very recognizable (and tasty) fillings. \\n\\nIf you are in the Highland Park area, you should absolutely treat yourself to the delicious baked goods at Food Glorious Food.\",\n",
       " u'This bakery is amazing!  We stopped on a whim after eating breakfast next door because the place looked cute and we are so glad that we did.  We got a chocolate chip cookie, a piece of their signature white cake with raspberry filling, a raspberry filled kolache, a cinnamon dough oval, and a brownie.  Everything was delicious!  The service was exceptional. There was a line out the door as we were leaving at about 11:30am. We will certainly go back as we are fussy about our baked goods and this place meets our standards.',\n",

       " u\"This place fills a void in Pittsburgh: a genuinely from-scratch bakery in the East End. I got a sampling of cookies, a quiche, a ham and cheese bun, a raspberry kolachie, and a cinnamon bun. Every item was uniquely simple and delicious.\\n\\nI ordered a pan of biscuits for my Saturday brunch and I can't wait to pick them up.\\n\\nI felt like I was in my great aunts kitchen. It's an extremely inviting and personal experience, I'll be a regular here from now on. \\n\\nLa Gourmandine is an amazing French bakery, but the atmosphere and quality at Food Glorious Food is something more than panache, it feels like home.\",\n",

Also, they take credit card!\\n\\nAnyway I settled on a pumpkin roll, which was amazing. First, the slices are huge. Second, the ratio of cream cheese frosting to cake is high, but I love it like that. Third, the flavor overall was perfect, not too sweet.\\n\\nCan't wait until next Wednesday!\",\n",
       " u\"I came here to buy some desserts for a dinner party later that evening. As it was my first time at Food Glorious Food, I asked the woman to help me choose a variety of desserts. She was patient and answered my questions on the various goods but for some reason I thought it would be a quicker process and she would be more decisive with suggesting things - it felt more drawn out. Also I had ordered a peanut butter caramel rice crispy treat and she did not cut it into pieces after she offered; and she placed the fruit tart near the flaps to the top so the cream got smushed into it.\\n\\nThat being said one of the guests really enjoyed the chocolate chip cookies - he ate one and then came back for the second; another enjoyed the napoleon; and the peanut butter caramel rice crispy treat and pumpkin roll were good. The desserts were good and had a homemade feel.\\n\\nBased on the other reviews I would like to come back and try other things here at the bakery such as the sandwiches, quiches, pies and cinnamon rolls - they've got a cute rustic sitting area, and they take credit card. I came here in the early afternoon on a Saturday so they may have sold out of some items.\",\n",
       " u\"I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010, and every single dealing I've had with AAA since I moved here has been great -- straightforward, super helpful people, and mostly quite brief wait times. \\n\\nThe agent that I have worked with from the start, whose name I think is Heather (long dark hair, second desk from the left), has always been willing to spend as much time with me as I needed to understand what I was buying and/or the process that I needed to go through.\\n\\nAlso, my car was totaled a couple of years ago (some jagoff who was texting rear-ended me, ahem, please don't do this), and they were phenomenal. I had a check for the full amount in less than a week.\\n\\nI see a lot of negative reviews here for services that are title related. I don't know if those people are even AAA employees, they might be DOT for all we know. I've had three title transactions, including one for a car that was from out of state, and they all went smoothly. \\n\\nI've been with AAA for more than 40 years, and when I lived in California I was seriously considering switching. Not anymore.\",\n",
       " u\"I never write reviews... but just had to for this piece of work. I usually blow off overly negative reviews (read prior reviews about this place) assuming they are disgruntled customers looking to whine about something.\\n\\nWell this place has been completely incompetent getting my title transferred from out of state. Weekly calls over 3 months, and now my temporary registration has been expired for a week and they don't know when I'll have legal plates. They promise to call me back right away, and it takes a week. \\n\\nIt is just frustrating that these folks are this incapable of completing a simple job. Go somewhere else. Anywhere else.\",\n",
       " u\"Going through AAA is a bit worse than your average DMV. The woman working the front desk was nice, but that was about the sum of it. The guy who processed our registration was patronizing and slow. He also made a mistake that required fixing after the fact. I can't say I'm enamored with the peculiarities of Pennsylvania licensing laws.\",\n",
       " u\"It is so painful for me to give this place a 5 star review, but when I think back to the bad times I've had here, it's because I was in a terrible mood when I walked in and it just didn't get better. \\nWhen you come here, be prepared to wait. I routinely wait for about an hour. Seems ridiculous? It used to piss me off but now I bring a magazine. \\nIt is better to have a AAA membership when you go here because you will get a discount, but it is the only DMV in the area. It is convenient because of that, and they do validate parking.\\nI recently bought an SUV out of state. The transfer could not have been easier, even with the messed up mileage written down by the idiot I bought it from. Can you believe he actually tried to sell me the truck with a Bill of Sale?? Yeah, um NO! (I'm just justifying calling him an idiot).\\nYou can get pretty much everything done here, even get your license renewed. Do not go here on the weekend. It is a zoo. And don't go here during lunch hours during the week. Around 2 in the afternoon on a weekday has done me well. \\nJust be patient and treat the employees with respect, and you will get out of here in one piece and maybe even in a good mood!\",\n",
       " u\"I have been a long time member and I have never experienced any problems (the few times I've called for service) until, last night. I accidentally locked my keys in my car before going into a social club I had just joined recently. After a few drinks I left to go home and realized what I had done.I called home to see if someone could come and bring me a spare key but, got no answer. So, I called AAA for help. After going through that STUPID menu (Press 1 for this, press 2 for that..etc) I was kept on HOLD for nearly a half and hour. What the hell! Do they only have one person answering the phone for the whole county. I finally gave up and decided to just walk home at around 11:45 at night. It was a real treat for someone 65 years old to walk nearly a mile alone late at night, half tipsy, on a street with no sidewalks(half of which was uphill). It could only have been worse if it were raining. I am lucky I didn't have a heart attack after making it to the top of the hill.\\nIf this is the kind of service they give now, I'm going to have to rethink about renewing by membership next year. I damn near crushed the card and threw it in the garbage can when I got home I was so angry.\",\n",
       " u\"This review is for the titling & registration of vehicles and not for other AAA services offered at this location. The good thing is that they have free parking. You have to go through the gate and the receptionist inside will give you a token to leave the parking lot. \\n\\nTiming is everything. If you go in beginning or end of month then it's generally busier. Saturdays are busier. It turned out I went on a Saturday at the beginning of a month (probably the worst time to go) and waited about 100 mins. The staff who processed my application was pleasant and made the process flow well once it was my turn. \\n\\nIt also depends what the customers are there for. Renewals take just a few mins whereas new registration and titling take up to 20-30 mins depending how prepared the customer is (i.e. do they have their previous title, insurance papers). Based on # of staff members x 20-30 mins/customer/staff member you can get an idea of what your wait time will be. I did not see a staff member process more than 3-4 applications per hour.\\n\\nI went in for a new title & registration and the process took about 25 mins as I was fully prepared with all the right paperwork. One thing that the AAA people will do here is go to your parked vehicle in the parking lot and physically verify the VIN on your vehicle (so no need to trace your VIN or go to a notary to get a picture of VIN notarized or anything).\",\n",
       " u'Terrible cashiers here \\n\\nVery rude\\n\\nThis homedepot is doing a terrible job \\n\\nNever again here',\n",
       " u\"I've always enjoyed this branch for my home repair needs.  It's quite close and never too busy.  The staff have always been nice and helpful.  One complaint I have is that the key maker/machine here seems a bit off.  Of the three times I've come to make copies of keys, I had to go back again because the first copies wouldn't fit very well.\",\n",
       " u\"Wow, this place gets railed in some of these reviews, but I actually kinda like this store.\\n\\nIt's your standard Home Depot in terms of product selection, so there is nothing too notable in that regard. The customer service experiences I've had here have actually been mostly positive. Over the last several months, I've been going paint crazy in our house, so I'm pretty much on a first name basis with the guys at the Home Depot paint counter (it's kind of embarrassing that I'm there so much to the point where they know me, but whatever). Anyway, Jamaal and the rest of the paint department staff have always been very helpful, giving me tips and advice on paint color, type, tools, etc. They're patient with me when I request tons of paint samples (and I know how super annoying that is). Dare I even say that I look forward to getting my paint here?! \\n\\nAs another example, we get our Christmas tree at Home Depot every year, and we've always been very pleased with how nice the staff has been in helping us tie it to our car. And just the other day my husband and I were in the plumbing aisle sizing up tools to help us unclog a drain, and an employee walked up to us and asked us if he could help. So nice. In fact, I can only recall one less-than-positive experience here, and it was when an employee mis-cut some wood for us (which we didn't know until we got it home and it wouldn't fit in our subfloor). So I guess the service hasn't been 100% perfect every time I've been here, but for a big box home improvement store, I've been very pleased overall. \\n\\nI do hate the parking lot though. Every time we go here, we pretty much count on the fact that someone will almost hit us, either while we're driving or walking into the store. Also, we have a compact car, but yet it seems like we barely fit in the parking spaces. With such a huge lot available, I'm not sure why they felt the need to make the parking spaces extra small, but it just adds to the craziness of the lot.\",\n",

Someone immediately offered assistance as soon as I walked in the door and directed me to the correct place to get keys cut.\\n\\nEmployee was very fast and pleasant as he cut my keys (which work perfectly in my doors).\\n\\nOnly downside is the parking lot craziness. I felt like I was going to get hit or hit someone else everywhere I turned.',\n",

It\\'s also closer to me than (dare i say it) walmart and if you use both websites, many things at this home depot are priced better. For example, my bathroom is small and has no windows so sometimes the air is moist. I looked online for good products and found \"Damp Rid\" it had nice reviews and seemed to be easy to figure out. This store only charged $3 for that item while walmart charged $7.50. \\n\\nJudge me but i also like walking around home depot.. checking out different types of kitchen cabinets or bath tubs whenever i come in.\\n\\nAn employee was happy to help us locate the damp rid and he had a good idea where it was located. Also, everyone we came across said hello and was kind. it was actually surprising. Kudos to home depot. They are doing something right to have so many happy employees. Yesterdays experience is the reason for 4 stars.',\n",
       " u\"Much better than I had expected for a home improvement store within city limits! Staff were helpful and knew exactly where to point me when I needed some guidance. The organization of the store is pretty much like Corporate dictates - the same as the rest. The items offered are reasonable quality, although most aren't super high end when it comes to fixtures and appliances. That being said, I have always been able to find a great many items that are key to maintaining my home in tip top shape. They keep a nice supply of LED bulbs, garden tools, hardware, and regular tools, so I am satisfied. I haven't ever consulted with them for a home improvement project, so I can't really comment on that aspect, but they definitely advertise the services! Will definitely be back due to it's convenient location.\",\n",
       " u\"I had drove past the building for years but, never went inside. My first time here was for a Yelp event and all I can say is wow! This is such as cool space and concept. \\n\\nThe building is two floors and divided to about five different areas. The gallery is a cool space and each time I've been there was a different cool display. There are also different sized class rooms for working on different types of projects. Such as the hot shop, cold shop and framing shop. I highly recommend seeing the glass blowing demonstration in the hot shop. It's pretty cool to see being done.\\n\\nMy daughter was been several times and loves it as much as I do. One event she went to was a totally FREE event for teens called Play by the Fire. It gave them the chance to make art with local organizations including:\\n\\nAssemble, were the teens got to build and test games using the scratch programming language and conductive materials. \\n\\nCarnegie Library of Pittsburgh, were the teens got to Learn the basics of Photoshop and become an all powerful fire Wizard with green screen.\\n\\nCarnegie Museum of Art, were the teens got to document the fun of Play by the Fire while experimenting with retro Polaroid cameras and learn how Pittsburgh Biennial artist, Corey Escoto, manipulates Polaroid film and combines photography with other materials to make imaginative works of art that are currently on view at Carnegie Museum of Art. \\n\\nMAKESHOP at Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, were the teens got to create a short stop-motion animation. Create and use handmade props to build a simple set. And work with an overhead camera to tell a story frame-by-frame.\\n\\nManchester Craftsmen's Guild, were the teens got to watch current students demonstrate on the potter's wheel, as well as use an interactive Photo booth.

       " u\"I'm always looking for unique ways to spend Valentine's Day.  This year, I celebrated by doing a make-it-now at the Glass Center with CM.  This event was held the evening of the day before Valentine's Day (2/13, a Fri.).  I'd been to the Glass Center in fall 2013 to observe an exhibition during RADical days, and had been meaning to try out a make-it-now, so this event provided the perfect opportunity to try my hand at glass craftsmanship as a novice.\\n\\nFor the V-Day event, you could choose between three items to make: a glass flower, a heart pendant, and a glass tile.  CM and I chose to make a glass flower, so upon checking into the glass center, we were told to go upstairs and check in at the hot shop.  Upon doing so, there was a 15-20 min. wait, given that many other couples were scheduled to do the activity at around the same time.  We passed the time by helping ourselves to some of the snacks that the Glass Center thoughtfully provided for participants.\\n\\nWhen we were called, we worked with an instructor from the Glass Center (I forget his name) to make our flower.  He first demonstrated the steps involved in the process, explaining each of them in turn.  We then chose the colors and design of our flower, and proceeded to work with our instructor to carry out each of the steps.  He was very patient and helpful throughout the whole process, despite our characteristic clumsiness!  Despite the amount of people and molten glass in the studio, crafting our flower was a breeze and a lot of fun, thanks to his guidance!\\n\\nAfter making our flower, we had to rush across the street because we had reservations for dinner at Verde.  After finishing dinner, we returned and observed the other make-it-now activities--the pendant in particular was fun to watch.  After they wrapped up, we went to the gallery to check out the glass art exhibit, which featured an arts program in Wilkinsburg.  We were even able to participate in it by adding to a mosaic that would be displayed at the program.  Finally, we checked out some of the glass art on exhibit by artists using the Glass Center in the foyer.\\n\\nOverall, we had an amazing time making our flower at the Glass Center during the V-Day make-it-now, and strongly recommend it as a unique V-Day activity.  The price was reasonable ($35), the activity was fun, and the staff was friendly.  The only drawbacks were: (1) it was crowded, due to the popularity of the event, and (2) you have to wait three days to pick up your item so that it can cool properly. Obviously, however, there's not much the Glass Center can do about them, so I'm awarding 5 stars for one of the most unique and fun venues and activities in PGH!\",\n",

       " u\"I went in to get a haircut. Never been here before and had no preference as to which beautician did it. The place is fun! Mainly due to no nonsense people that work there. It isn't a glamorous spot like so many other salons in shadyside, but you get experienced people with great sense of humor and down to earth attitude, that above all listen to what you want. I ended up with Michelle, and I loved what she did with my hair! It's perfect! $31 overall for a cut and blow dry. I'll be back!\",\n",

       " u\"I ordered a large pepperoni and gyro. Delivery was quick for a Saturday night in the rain. I unwrapped the gyro and was very happy to see gyro meat that was freshly sliced (from an actual spit), and pita that was nicely toasted. Pizza Parma's tzatziki (cucumber sauce) was a little thin and runny, but the flavor was good. The pizza was well composed with small, crisp rounds of pepperoni evenly covering the surface. The cheese and sauce on the pie was balanced nicely and not too saucy or cheesy.  Crust was quite thin, not too bubbly or voluminous. All in all I was very pleased with my Pizza Parma experience. The pizza I had tonight was tasty and a little above average but the gyro was a true delight.\",\n",
       " u'We ordered their supreme pizza (Parma Pizza). It tasted like a frozen pizza, but with less flavor (which is an impressive feat). The crust was hard and flavorless. We also had the chocolate cake. This was a mistake. Avoid this place at all costs.',\n",
       " u\"The last time I was here must have been an off day (my previous review gave this place one star) My appt was at 9am I was home by 9:30.

       " u\"I made an account for several reasons: mostly because I've been meaning to, but partially because this place is getting a bad rep here.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a fancy laundromat, a place to hang out, or a place to put your clothes in and leave for an hour, this isn't the place for you.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a laundromat with machines that work just fine, low prices by comparison to other local laundromats, and timely removal, this is the place for you.\\n\\nFor me, I like to put my clothes into the washers (minimum 2.25 for the top loaders, 2.75 for greater capacity although it is rarely necessary), start them up, and go next door to the Turkish convenience store. Grab a Coke, go back to the laundromat, sit down with a book and read. 28 minutes go by, the machine beeps, and I move the clothes to the dryer. Throw three quarters in there and dry on high, and they're done in a little over 20 minutes. In total, a week's worth of laundry costs about 3 bucks, maybe 3.25 if you like your clothes scorching hot out of the dryer.\\n\\nThe machines are always clean when I go, and there's a parking lot in the back. Do your business, get out in under an hour.\\n\\nYes, the walkway is a little narrow between the machines, but that helps when you're transferring clothes. The floors aren't the cleanest, but you're not there for floors. There's an ATM inside and a change machine that's always worked for me. No bathroom, unfortunately, so I can't give it five stars, but everything else is in great order.\\n\\nIt's in a convenient location, it's cheap, and it gets the job done. Get in, get out. If you're looking for more, why?\",\n",
       " u\"Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  \\n\\nAnyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  \\n\\nAlso if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!\",\n",
       " u\"I love going here, if you shop smart it really isn't your whole paycheck and is less expensive than other options in the area (Market District I'm looking at you). I only buy the store brand unless I need something special for a recipe, and my bill is consistently less than anything I bought at Market District. The quality of the produce and the meat cannot be matched anywhere in the city, unless you go down to the Strip. But hands down my favorite thing about going here are the employees. If you read anything about the corporate structure or culture of Whole Foods you'll understand why everyone seems so happy to be working. I have never had a request met with anything less than a smile, and I love that they are willing to let you try a new product before committing to the whole purchase.\",\n",
       " u'Great place to eat and shop. Never a dull moment. This place change the face of east Liberty for the better. I was still shop here for all my needs. Love you WFM!!',\n",
       " u'Awesome place \\n\\nGreat costumer service \\n\\nLots of groceries should learn from them \\n\\nWill come again',\n",
       " u\"I love Whole Foods!  I know that it's pricey and sometimes people scoff when they hear others say that there are certain things that one can only find at WF but it's TRUE!  I do try to do a lot of my shopping at Trader Joes and Market District, but the Market District on Centre Ave is almost comparable in price for the same products at WF and sometimes a little more expensive.  This WF is clean, well laid out, and the staff overall are helpful and friendly though I've run into some employees with attitude particularly at the checkouts, but overall it's a great store and you just have to know that not everything is organic (always read your labels) and that the parking lot will always be a nightmare.  Overall this is a great Whole Foods just avoid shopping here just before any major holiday because it's always madness!\",\n",
       " u\"Every once in a while, when I'm feeling particularly flush, I battle the evil that is the WF parking lot. I tell myself it will totally be worth it in order to class it up with some high quality goodies.  \\n\\nThe fish and meat selection are out of the park when it comes to freshness.  However, I've purchased flowers twice and each time they were dead by day three.  Both times I allowed the molten flowers to remain on the counter an extra day to serve as a reminder why I'm not WF material.\",\n",
       " u'I found a bone in a package of in-store made turkey burgers (the tequila lime ones if it matters). Not cool.',\n",
       " u\"The parking lot is always a zoo and that alone will give me a bit of anxiety if I think of going to Whole Foods. People get pretty crazy driving around in that lot..like mean and road-ragey. Yes, this place is more expensive and that keeps me from shopping there on the regular. It's always packed when I go in as well. What I do like about them is the selection of flowers (I don't always buy, but it's nice), availability of very specific items, great selection of all kinds of foods, and a nice area of prepared food if you want to take something to go or eat there. It's a clean store and the employees are nice. I find it's easy to navigate. It's definitely a good place if you're trying to find items for a recipe you don't usually make (like me...boursin garlic herb cheese? I found it here). It's vegan and vegetarian friendly..both of which I am not, but still a great option for other individuals. I will say again the parking lot keeps me away a lot though if you happen to score a sweet spot, it's a great idea to peruse the aisles and you may just find something new to check out for a lower price.\",\n",
       " u\"Overpriced and overwhelming. I made the mistake of going -- ONCE-- on a weekend. Never again. The parking lot felt like I was in a David Fincher-directed game of Frogger. It's always, always so congested and busy and filled with entitled customers. I was checked into a magazine rack once when a guy tried to beat me to a check-out lane. Some of the fresh stuff is nice, but it's definitely not worth the anxiety attack.\",\n",
       " u\"My favorite grocery store in Pittsburgh. When I lived with my parents in forest hills it was worth the 15 to 20 minute drive to shop here. Lots and lots of organic produce. Everything you would need to stock your fridge and pantry plus lots of more exotic options too. Much of the produce comes in conventionally farmed and organic options so pay attention to the labels and signs if you're aiming for all organic. It is more expensive to shop here than most grocery stores but you really do get what you pay for. \\nThe bulk section has lots of nuts, seeds, beans and grains.\\nThe meat counter looks pretty great with some grass fed and organic options (a bit out of my price range for every day eating but its good to know its there for a special occasion). Their seafood counter is passable (that being said, I worked at Wholey's fish market for a while so I have really high standards when it comes to seafood. Not that Wholeys fish always meets my standards, but I'm used to huge variety and at least a few incredibly fresh options). Much of the seafood is previously frozen because it's out of season or exorbitantly expensive when fresh. I honestly can't believe people who shop at whole foods have any interest in irresponsibly farmed fish like tilapia and Chilean Atlantic salmon but they carry it nonetheless. \\nStaff are friendly but can't always answer what you might think is a simple question. As in the bulk foods guy probably knows everything about the bulk foods but literally has no clue where you can find horseradish.\\nSalad bar and hot foods are good and seam fresh. The sushi is passable if you're really in the mood for quick sushi. There's not a very big baked good section and I've never tried what they do have but my dad likes their cookies. \\nI usually bike there now, but when I used to drive the parking lot was sort of a mess. Just be prepared to walk from the far end (I'm sure you'll all survive). \\nLines at the registers can be long but seem to move fast. People complain so much about how crazy busy this place is, but they have obviously just never been to the whole foods in Columbus circle NYC.\",\n",
       " u'I found out the caterpillar in the romaine bag. Eww it climbed up on my arm. Goosebumps :( BUT at least it can be the proof of \"organic\" besides the bug was green!!!! So healthy !',\n",
       " u\"I've been to many whole foods market particularly in CA. I was really excited having a Whole Foods market near my apartment; however, I am really disappointed with this location. The deli (pre-made/salad bar/hot bar) selection is limited and the food is subpar. The parking lot is teeny tiny. If I had a choice, I would go to the Wexford location.  Definitely should stop by if you're in the area.\",\n",
       " u\"When I travel for work, I often stop at Whole Foods to pick up prepared meals.  I know that I will get a good lunch or dinner, and the price is comparable to most upscale fast food options.    A few weeks ago I was really sick and came in to pick up a cold remedy, lunch, and orange juice.  This Whole Foods is just not quite up to the national standard.\\n\\nFirst, this Whole Foods is fairly small, but the parking situation is a disaster.  There is not adequate parking, and the kind of people who shop at this particular Whole Foods are the worst people ever.  People will try to run you over in the parking lot to get the last spot.  It's actually pathetic.\\n\\nThe store is set-up a bit odd, and the employees aren't particularly friendly here.  I felt like I was begging someone to find Sambucus, which just isn't fun when you don't feel well.  However, the cashiers were up to par.\\n\\nThe biggest kick in the face was the prepared foods section.  At 11:00 AM on a Thursday there was no prepared food set up.  No soup, no entrees.  Just some leftover Oatmeal that had hardened from breakfast and the name tags for the prepared food that would eventually come out.  There are only two small serving stations as well, and a lot of my favorite options were missing, like the mac and cheese.\\n\\nIf you are just looking to do standard grocery shopping here, then this Whole Foods is just fine.  The grocery selections were pretty standard, and the aisles are wide enough.  This Whole Foods is a big step up from the gross Market District down the street, but the standard is pretty low here as well.\",\n",
       " u\"I've read some critical reviews, mostly from others who report coming from more fabulous locations. I live an hour outside of Pittsburgh where Giant Eagle is the only option, and so a trip to Whole Foods is like a visit to the Mother Land, with amazing organic options like sprouts (unheard of where I live). I love love love this Whole Foods and look forward to going, whenever I can get there.\",\n",
       " u\"Meatless Monday is a great way to raise awareness about vegetarian or vegan diet, which also happens to be the least arduous way to reduce your carbon footprint, save water, prevent ecological pollution, and reduce deforestation, because it requires so much energy to raise animals for food. When we can simply, and deliciously, I might add eat what they eat. 1 pound of ground beef requires 550 gallons of water. I was there on Monday and I had a really good feature dish, with pink rice from Madagascar and tofu, marinated in a ginger orange dressing (delicious) served with kale, carrots, pumpkin seeds, red & green onions, and a coconut yogurt dressing. The young chef was very nice and knowledgeable, and quite comfortable, talking while making my dinner. I paid for it, blessed it, thanked all who made it possible, ate, and it was awesome!  I went back to thank and compliment the chef. He seemed grateful. Then I got a few groceries I needed and left. Thanks to cool chef, and Whole Foods team! I'll be back soon enough!\",\n",
       " u\"I, in theory, love Whole Foods. I love the produce selection, the cheeses, and the meats. The hot bar is lovely and the bakery pretty good. When I moved to Pittsburgh, I was elated to finally have a Whole Foods I could shop at! \\n\\nBut the experience is just... unpleasant. Humans in BMW's/Audi's/beat up subarus have turned into vultures, circling... waiting... for the next spot to open up in the impossibly tiny lot. There are no words to describe the anguish of being stuck behind one of these vultures stalking a shopper with a full grocery cart, only to see a spot just ahead, that someone else pounces on while you helplessly look on. It sounds trivial and I get that this is a city, but is this what one really wants to deal with as they are trying to run errands on their day off when there are other, less stressful options near by? \\n\\nAnd, you know, I think the trauma of trying to find a parking spot remains with the shoppers long after parking their car because people the atmosphere is kind of stressful inside as well. The jockeying for the shortest line in the check out, the pushing people out of the way for the last organic horseradish root... it's about the same as any other urban grocery store but after the parking! Knowing the dangerous gauntlet I must run to get back to my car with my groceries! The prices! It's just not worth it. \\n\\nAnd I'd be willing to forgive all of this if it were an above average Whole Foods, but it's not. This brings me, at last, to the turkey. I called ahead in late October TWICE to make sure the turkey I ordered would be fresh for Thanksgiving. It was supposed to be fresh. It was labelled fresh. But it was frozen. If I'm going to pay 60 bucks for a bird, it really should come as labeled and advertised. I don't need the stress of hoping my bird will thaw before the big day (spoiler alert... it won't). Especially not after the parking lot.\\n\\nEDIT: Well, customer service was awesome and they refunded my frozen turkey. I amend to 3*... thanks customer service!\",\n",
       " u\"Maybe I'm just not the kind of person that likes Whole Foods.\\n\\nI don't mind paying a bit more for quality groceries, but the East End Food Co-op is a bit cheaper (in my opinion) for the same products.  The store itself is very, very hard to navigate- it seems to always be super crowded.  I've never used a buggy, only a basket, and even trying to maneuver that is a nightmare.  In my opinion, there's just too much going on in the space that they have; food displays at the ends of aisles, sample tables, seated tables at the front...and no room to actually shop.  Either someone's in your way or you're in their way.  The parking lot, well..I feel the other reviews have that covered.\",\n",
       " u\"what a horrible thanksgiving dinner, dry turkey, lumpy pototoes, freaky string beans, this is a real live and learn never again, wrote to the store for a comment, but no response, this was to expensive to waste, but that's exactly what it was\",\n",
       " u'Great experience! We hired the Prop Shop for a business dinner function in Salamanca, New York. The Prop Shop team traveled from Pittsburgh to set up and tear down our function in the same day, they did a great job. Our group enjoyed the pool tables, foosball, air hockey, monster basketball and chic seating arrangements. Everyone felt like a kid again. Great activity for business and families alike. Professional and friendly staff!',\n",
       " u\"I needed an oil change and general safety inspection, but I was having trouble finding a place with decent reviews that took appointments and had weekend hours. I called this AAMCO and the guy said that they usually only do transmission work on the weekend, so their mechanics/general tech guys aren't in. However, he offered to schedule me for a Saturday morning appointment as he was going to be in that weekend anyway. I was happy to accept his offer and the actual appointment went very well. The man I spoke with and who worked on my car is very personable and accommodating, and the maintenance he performed on my car was done well and priced fairly. I don't know if they will always be able to accommodate my schedule, but my experience thus far is that they are at least willing to try.\",\n",
       " u\"I have a very, very rudimentary base of knowledge when it comes to cars. Mechanics probably pick up this scent within seconds of me walking in the door. So when it came time to get the oil changed in my new-to-me 2010 Honda Civic, I turned to Yelp to help find a place with a solid rating. As far as oil-changing joints go, this AAMCO location stood out among others in the East End. Here's why it gets a high rating in my book...\\n\\nI called two days ahead of time to schedule. They could take me early Friday morning-- the sooner the better. Well, I was out late celebrating a birthday the night prior and overslept. I called back to reschedule for another day, but they were able to squeeze me in in the afternoon. I went in thinking I was going to be dropping $80 for synthetic oil, but Brian, the shop manager and co-owner is a Honda guy himself and said regular oil would work just fine. I asked him if he could check out the condition of my brakes and tires. Instead of doing a quick visual, he took the tires off to check. Moreover, he rotated them, so my best tires are up front, where they should be. All told, the bill came to under $40 and I was in and out in under an hour.\\n\\nAlong with his business partner, Jim, Brian took over the AAMCO in the latter half of 2014 and he officially became a co-owner on 1 December. He has years of experience working on cars, first as a hobby, and then after a long time in the restaurant business, as an employed mechanic. The customer service was great. I was greeted promptly and with a handshake. After returning to pick up my car, Brian and I spoke for about 10 minutes after the shop had closed for the day. He has plans to renovate the shop to make it better for both his customers and employees, as well as to offer deals through social media.\\n\\nI'll need tires soon and brake job down the line-- I'll be returning to AAMCO for both. It was great walking away not only with the feeling that I didn't get screwed this time around, but that I have a reliable, knowledgeable place where I can go for any mechanical issues. Bottom line: can't recommend this place highly enough.\",\n",
       " u\"Best Mechanic Shop Ever!\\n\\nPros: Brian has amazing customer service skills. He calls you once the car is opened up and then like a surgeon diagnosis the problem with honesty and some truth. What I mean is he says 'I believe with 96% probability that ____so_and_so_is_the_issue___  with your car. I really like the honesty and trust he conveys when discussing the diagnosis. Just like with humans, Doctors are unable to always predict with 100% certainty that a person has a specific disease and Brian says it how it is as well. It brings the conversation down to Earth and I haven't had that type of service at a mechanics shop especially in a large city. \\n\\nAfter fixing the car he actually brings out the old part and explains everything they did to fix the car. He goes into detail in layman terms and it reassures you as the customer in the care and trust they take to fix your car. \\n\\n\\nCons: Even for basic service it often takes +3 days to do.\",\n",
       " u'I took my Jeep to Brian and Jim\\'s shop a month ago because I heard a grinding noise at about 20 mph and above in the general area of the rear wheels.  I talked with Brian a several times and he seems to be a knowledgable and good guy.  They found a used \"rear end\" and installed it at what seems like a reasonable price.  Jeep sounded great when I got it back.  It\\'s now two weeks later and the same (or similar) sound is back.  When I called Brian said essentially, \"Bring it right in and we\\'ll take a look.\"  I like this shop.',\n",
       " u\"I just got back from getting my oil changed here. Brian, one of the new co-owners, could not have been nicer and more polite both on the phone and in person. I called a lot of places trying to make an appointment, and was turned down pretty rudely until I finally called Aamco and spoke to Brian. He got me in the next day (which everyone who works a 9-5 during the weekdays will be happy to hear was actually a Saturday--they're open Saturday mornings!) and I was in and out with little issue and reasonable prices. Brian was there to meet me when I got there, and also fixed a loose splash guard next to my front wheel free of charge. I will definitely be going to Aamco for my future car needs. \\n\\nP.S. If you're the type that doesn't really like just hanging out in the garage while you wait for them to finish with your car, Aamco is pretty conveniently located just off Baum, behind the AAA building, so you can leave, walk around, shop for some groceries across the street, or grab a coffee at Starbucks while you wait.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'ve been going to see Larry at Aamco for years and was always pleased with the timing and results. Larry retired in December and now Brian is a co-owner with Jim. Both are incredibly nice and accommodating. Recently I had to get my annual inspection but was in the middle of getting a temp registration because I lost the original and was supposed to get it later that day. Brian said he\\'d be able to do everything except the emissions test and when I get the temp to bring it over and he\\'ll finish it up. He could have easily told me to make another appointment when I have all the correct documentation but didn\\'t.\\nAfter I got them the temp registration and they finished the inspections, I thanked them and apologized for everything and Brian said, \"well we strongly believe that if you\\'re good to your customers they\\'ll be good right back to you.\" So this is my first yelp review, something which I never thought I\\'d participate in, but these guys deserve it.',\n",
       " u'Honest guys. Fixed me right up with a quick appt.',\n",
       " u'I do not usually write reviews unless I am upset, but this Aamco is the exception.  I brought my car in for the state inspection after a bad experience at another shop.  The new owner was extremely accommodating, personable, and honest.  After an hour, he told me my car was fine and offered guidance on future maintenance my car would require, but did not try to push it on me as it was not necessary at the time.  I was in a hurry so I opted to decline, but this Aamco will definitely be getting the work when it is time for it, though.',\n",
       " u'I called the office to get a lightbulb replaced, one of their maintenance staff took pictures inside my apartment without my knowledge or permission. Apparently my dog not being in his crate while I was not home was not up to Franklin Wests\\' standards, so they sent me a letter including the pictures that were taken without my knowledge.  After receiving their threatening letter \"reminding me\" of the lease I regretfully signed, my fianc\\xe9 called them to ask why  they were taking pictures inside our apartment without our knowledge. They said they can enter our apartment any time they like, which apparently means they can photograph your things as well. \\n\\nIf you have pets, don\\'t even bother renting from any of their properties. Pet deposit/rent is ridiculous. I get harassed that my dog needs to be crated when I\\'m gone. Oh they even suggested I put my baby in doggy day care, how the **** am I supposed to afford that when I\\'m paying a security deposit, pet deposit, rent, and pet rent? I\\'ve basically been told I\\'m not getting my security deposit back.  Their reasoning that my dog has to be crated is for the SAFETY of their maintenance guys. My dog is a 10 lb papillon. One of the pictures they sent me while they decided to do a photo shoot inside my apartment was of my dog laying down on the bed. Very vicious indeed. I\\'m scared to even be in my own home now. That\\'s not a life I\\'m comfortable with. Especially because my dog is a registered emotional companion dog that my doctor and vet each sent letters to Franklin West stating that, yet is still considered a threat. \\n\\nSix months left on my lease... Wish me luck guys. \\n\\nPs- If you do go into their leasing office you will see one of the employees\\' dog roaming around, while mine is locked in a crate. DO THEY NOT SEE THE HYPOCRISY?',\n",
       " u'Basically a group of lawyers who understand how to use archaic Pittsburgh laws to screw over students. Ridiculous policies and move out fees. Their auto renewing leases are  set in as traps',\n",
       " u'In the past several months the employees have made my fianc\\xe9 and I much more comfortable. They call us before entering our apartment (with the exception of when we were out of town and had a large package delivered, they put it inside our living room). Also, they are more pleasant to us in general after we voiced our frustrations with them. Originally we signed a 12 month lease, knowing we would only be living in Pittsburgh for 9. They helped get our apartment signed by new tenants and we are able to get out of our lease early without breaking or violating it. They have done a great job changing my feelings about them. \\n\\nJustin and Maureen are the only Franklin West employees that were always courteous.',\n",
       " u\"Kamin Realty showed a profound lack of professionalism. \\nWould take several days to respond to e-mails, if they chose to respond at all. \\nI had to make several phone calls to ever get a response from a Kamin representative who was not helpful or gracious to work with.\\n\\nPut a deposit down on a place, however 3 days later, due to unforeseen circumstances I had to cancel. Instead of working with me on refunding or possibly working out a re-advertising cost Kamin denied any services and left me out $700 dollars. \\n\\nIn the end, I am glad things didn't work out since they seemed like they would be horrible landlords.\",\n",
       " u'I haven\\'t even moved into my apartment yet and I\\'m already regretting renting a property with Kamin. Paul showed us the apartment and he was very nice. I would give him a 5 start rating. It\\'s the woman who answers the phones and emails that I find extremely rude and off-putting. So far, she has hung up on me on the phone, raised her voice to me multiple times, and told me to \"get myself a calendar\" when I asked to get back into my apartment during the week of Memorial Day. I then sent an email with questions for Paul because I didn\\'t want to deal with her anymore. Paul never saw my email and instead she answered my long email of questions with a one word sentence. \\n\\nIf I could back out of my lease at this point, I totally 100% would, solely because of the receptionist. But unfortunately I am trapped. Their apartments are decent, but the receptionist needs to attend a few sessions of customer service training and general etiquette courses.',\n",
       " u\"Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio, which was much better.\\n\\nThe drinks we ordered from the bar were watery (the Manhattan and some drink with applejack in it). Later, they made a mistake and sent us the wrong cocktail, which turned out to be much better than the ones we wanted. \\n\\nAppetizers (meatballs with Brussels sprouts and beet salad) were very good, but the main courses left a lot to be desired in terms of seasoning.  The texture of the short rib in the ravioli wasn't quite right, sort of dry, maybe overcooked.  We had a bread pudding for dessert, which was probably the best part of the meal. I expect a better overall experience for the money.\",\n",
       " u'Great place for so many occasions. My husband took me on our first date here for a very intimate night out (I definitely was impressed).  He took me back for a surprise birthday party in their downstairs area. The food is always out of this world. I have said to my self on multiple occasions (while reading the menu) \"i\\'m not sure what some of these ingredients are but Casbah never disappoints\" and they never have!! I can\\'t wait to live in Pittsburgh again, this is my first stop.',\n",
       " u'Stopped here for drinks before we went on to dinner elsewhere. In hindsight, we wish we had stayed here. :-)\\n\\nWe had a couple of great beers and just enjoyed the excellent music soundtrack before we moved on to our next designation. I hope to come back here sometime in the future and actually have...a meal. I like this funkier part of town.',\n",
       " u\"I don't know of any place that comes to close to the quality of Mediterranean food offered at Casbah.  They have a daily menu that combines unique ingredients into a great blend.  My favorites on their menu are their spinach casareccia (which I customize with tuna steak instead of chicken) and their gnocchi (in that order).  They are open to customizing their menu so if you want half and half of each dish, they are happy to do that for you.  That is a huge plus for me.  They are safely my favorite Big Burrito restaurant\",\n",
       " u\"I am a huge fan of almost all things Big Burrito and Casbah is no exception.  I have been to Casbah so many times over the years that the visits all meld together, but on this particularly occasion I had the arugula salad to begin with which was delicious and my friend had the butternut squash soup which she really enjoyed.  We both ordered the the Scottish Salmon which was so delicious and tender that it literally melted in my mouth.  The house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.  Their wine list is always spectacular - on this visit I had a glass of the Riesling from Urban, Germany and my friend had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Lenotti, Italy.  We had no room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit and I am a die-hard chocolate fan and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen to try Casbah for brunch again soon.\",\n",
       " u'I enjoyed my previous experiences at Casbah, but this past weekend was a disappointment. Despite having a reservation well in advance, my husband and I were seated at a horrible table right next to the hallway that leads to the kitchen and bathrooms. There was a constant stream of distractions. Service was also really slow and my sea bass was bland. I expected better from Casbah...',\n",
       " u'I really enjoyed my dining experience at Casbah.\\n\\nThe cheese plate was extremely large and really good.  There was a nice balance of cheese to eat.\\n\\nMy date and I both ordered pasta dishes.  When a restaurant makes their own pasta from scratch, how do you order anything else?  The non-pasta dishes that went past our table looked great, but I think we made the right decisions.\\n\\nMy date had a pasta with scallops and crab.  It was amazing.  I had a pasta with kale and sausage.  It was equally amazing.  I felt Casbah was heavy on their sauce.\\n\\nCasbah has a large wine selection, but I felt the stand out option was the port wine flight for desert.',\n",
       " u'I had my first experience with Casbah on a recent Friday night in a group of 4 without a reservation arriving around 9pm. Here is a summary of our experience: \\n\\nPROS: \\n- Ambiance is nice, upscale, not too loud. \\n- We were able to find a low table in the bar within 15 minutes. \\n- Drinks were good, generously proportioned. Cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place ($10-$14). Wine list had multiple options by the glass.\\n- As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared. \\n\\nCONS: \\n- Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way. \\n- The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have \"excellent sourdough bread\", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn\\'t get to have). \\n\\nFOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions)\\n- Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them. \\n- Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked. \\n- Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash \\n- Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn\\'t feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter. \\n- Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well.\\n- Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno\\'s. \\n\\nOVERALL: \\nA similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won\\'t be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn\\'t that good even discounting the service. I\\'m sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there.',\n",
       " u\"After a few misses in Pittsburgh, Casbah came through. Most of the dishes were pretty good, though I think the pork chops are the best. My pasta was very good - great savory and flavorful sauce. Portions were large too. If you're in town and need a solid place to go, Casbah is a great pick.\",\n",
       " u\"Oh, Casbah. I love when I get the opportunity to dine within your walls. Your food is delicious. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a lovely dinner this past weekend. Did I mention that it was his birthday?\\n\\nWe were seated outside along the catwalk (aka, the walkway from the front door into the main restaurant). It was a chilly night, so the heaters above us were pumping out the heat. I mean, it wasn't warm, it was h-o-t. Yes. It was better than freezing our tooshes off, but it was a bit, well, uncomfortable to say the least.\\n\\nNow onto the positives...\\n\\nWe devoured the Veal & Pork Meatballs for an appetizer. The Anson Mills polenta, roasted tomato, garlic, crispy Brussels sprouts, and parmigiano-reggiano played very nicely together.\\n\\nFor our main entrees, I ordered the gnocchi. This wasn't just any gnocchi. Instead, duck confit, brussels sprouts, figs, lacinato kale, thyme, pecorino romano, and shag bark hickory nuts accompanied the fluffy little pillows of goodness.\\n\\nHe ordered the Casbah double-cut pork chop served with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, and sage jus.\\n\\nNo dessert this time - trying to keep my New Year's Resolution.\\n\\nSee you soon, Casbah\",\n",
       " u\"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh; I've never been disappointed after dining at Casbah! We received a gift card and enjoyed a fabulous dinner starting with the mussels appetizer in a tomato based sauce.  Yum!  And then I had lamb loin with sweet potatoes and brussel spouts and cherry sauce.  What a beautiful presentation and taste.  My husband had the pasta with scallops and crabmeat.  He was equally pleased with his dish. We really liked the wine selection too!  We had cappuccino for our dessert, and it was the perfect ending to the meal.  We'll definitely be back!\",\n",
       " u\"I think Casbah is a bit underrated. Pittsburgh has a number of very good restaurants: Legume, Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, Eleven, and Cure make up the pentagon of the best places in town. Casbah, along with Salt, are in that second tier.\\n\\nMy partner and I have been here for dinner twice. Each time, I thought the food was very good. I can't remember what my order was the first time we came here, but the most recent time I had a mushroom bisque soup, meatballs and the gnudi for the appetizers (split between the two of us), and the sea bass for the entree. I really enjoyed the mushroom bisque, but it's definitely for those who like strong mushroom flavors. The sea bass came on a bed of delicious polenta, which: I don't usually expect polenta to be amazing, but this one was. The sea bass itself was moist and flaky with tons of flavor. My partner had the lamb, and thought it was good but also suspected it might have been too raw inside (it was more than pink). The drinks were also quite good, if not stellar.\\n\\nCasbah also has a very pleasant atmosphere, even though it's quite large inside. The wait staff is helpful without being in the way; one of my least favorite things is having a waiter or waitress ask me within seconds of getting my food how everything is (give me a few minutes to actually eat it, ok?) and mercifully nothing like that happened here. A very nice dining experience overall.\",\n",
       " u'Casbah is one of my favorite spots for an after-work drink or a romantic meal. The lighting and decor are very calming and inviting. The menu is refined Mediterranean with some modern twists. The waitstaff is attentive, timely, and always takes care of my food allergies. I always order sea bass or some sort of fish here, because they sear it to perfection. The chef actually made up their own side for my dish because I was allergic to the one on the menu. I received delicious crispy potatoes and sauteed arugula. Fantastic touch! They have a great wine list, as well. I would recommend Casbah to pretty much anyone, but it is especially nice for a one-on-one meal or a drink at the bar.',\n",
       " u\"Have I mention I LOVE the Big Burrito group? All I did was confirm that I still wanted to be subscribed to their email list and they sent me a free lunch entree for responding. I decided to use this coupon to try one of their restaurants that I haven't yet.\\nYUM. I decided to go with the Piccola Gusta option, so that I could try a bit of everything. I went with the arugula salad, gnocchi and sword fish sandwich. It was all outstanding.\\nUnfortunately there was a large dark hair in my salad that I noticed immediately (thank goodness) and our waiter took care of it promptly. A lot of times I would let that ruin my experience but I tried very hard to not let it. Anyway, finished the meal with the carrot gob. Again, yum!!\\nOur service after that was just okay. He seemed to kind of forget about us? It was a bit odd. At one point we had no forks for a while with entrees in front of us. I guess I always expect something a little more as far as service when something like a hair accident happens.\\nThe food makes this place hands down as long as there isn't hair in it! We sat in the covered indoor porch area which was cute for lunch, but honestly seemed as though they segregated people by their appearance in who sat inside when going in to use the restroom. \\nOnce they work on their service Casbah could easily be 5 stars. Maybe next time!\",\n",
       " u\"This past Sunday my girlfriends and I decided we would do a post-Valentines brunch at Casbah, and it was just what we were looking for. They have a deal where you get a brunch cocktail, appetizer, and entree for only $28. This was a great deal in my opinion. The food was delicious. I had the smoked salmon appetizer and the sea scallop entree. The scallops were perfectly prepared, not chewy or gummy. They were accompanied with sweet potatoes and onions and usually sausage- I asked the waiter for no sausage as I'm not a meat eater. All in all a great experience and we will definitely be back!\",\n",
       " u'It\\'s hard to judge and review based on takeout alone, especially at a place with such an atmosphere like Casbah, but here it\\'s goes...\\n\\nMy boss decided to treat us all for lunch so I looked for something that appealed to me. I must admit that the menu scared me at first. It\\'s definitely more of an upscale kind of place, but not quite a \"suit & tie\" affair. I settled on the bacon and turkey club. Seemed safe. \\n\\nI didn\\'t think it was anything amazing. Yes, I said it. I\\'ve been looking forward to eating here, too! The sandwich was just sort of... plain. The sauces were bland and did nothing for me. It all just seemed very dry. Aside from the tasty bread and bacon, I wasn\\'t too impressed. For a cheaper price, I could have ordered a club sandwich from a mom and pop\\'s greasy spoon and been more satisfied. \\n\\nI also ordered a salad which consisted of lettuce and beets. Dressing was okay, but a little tangy. \\n\\nAll in all, I\\'d like to return and actually enjoy a meal in the restaurant. Atmosphere does a lot for a place so a trip back is definitely in order. Also, I\\'d like to actually study the menu and ask some questions to make sure I can order something good. At work I was a little rushed to make a decision.\\n\\nSide note - the takeout packaging is awesome. High quality microwaveable/reusable plasticware!',\n",
       " u'I want to start by saying that it kills me to give Casbah two stars and I wish there were two rating systems - one for the food and another one for service since my review is really about the latter. The food as always is exceptional.\\n\\nI have been going to Casbah for well over a decade and it is a place where my family has always celebrated special occasions because of the wonderful atmosphere, food and the great service - or what used to be great service. \\n\\nWe went to Casbah last night for dinner to celebrate a family birthday expecting to have a nice, memorable evening. Alas! that wasn\\'t to be. Our server (Seth) and the service provided by him can be described in just one word - INDIFFERENCE. He went through the motions of taking our order and bringing us our food but that was it. We were never told of any specials. We were not brought any bread till we asked for it. We were not asked for re-fills on our drinks or even our water. We were not once asked how the food was and if we needed anything else. On ordering dessert, we were not asked if we needed coffee or drinks to go with and so on. In my book, indifference is worse than bad service.  \\n\\nI could have looked past it if it was just the server\\'s style and lack of work ethic (every place has some of those people!) but what really highlighted this lackluster service was that the very same server was providing exceptional service to a neighboring table with a much larger party than ours. Perhaps because gratuity was automatically included? I don\\'t know but suffice to say I was very disappointed and somewhat annoyed. \\n\\nCasbah is not your \"neighborhood\" place to drop in for dinner and the food and ambiance don\\'t come cheap. So the least they can do is to make sure that service is consistent. It is relatively easy to attract new customers but really tough to sustain them.  I hope this was just a one-time occurrence but I feel like I need to highlight it in a public forum in the hope that someone from Big Burrito sees this and has it addressed. \\n\\nI\\'m so disappointed. I hope I can go back there again. I would hate to lose this place!',\n",
       " u\"The hubby and I got here super early so we went to the bar and had wine, the Boyd and basil, and blood and sand. All very very good. We then got sat at a table outside. They have an amazing outdoor patio that's covered and heated in the winter, you wouldn't even know the difference! Except I'm always cold as is and we were originally sat NOT under heat vents. We DID ask for a different table, basically because im\\nA baby and couldn't handle it, it wasn't THAT cold, but cooler than I could handle. The charred octopus was good to start, our server Rebecca was amazing! Very sweet and professional, def knew her stuff. For entrees we had the filet mignon and pork chop. The filet was on point, my only complaint was that they didn't take temps on the pork. We would've loved it medium but they cook it med well or so, which of course, is going to make it a little dry and tough. Dessert was great and we had olives and a cheese plate to go, overall s great evening!\",\n",
       " u\"Although we've only had brunch here, I'm not totally sure that we'll be back for dinner service.  Casbah is a whopping .2 miles from home (that's at least a thousand feet!) so while its convenience and accepting of reservations reign high on my list of must-haves, the food left me slightly disappointed.  Considering the price point here, we've dropped a star level or so.\\n\\nI made reservations for brunch (definitely do this; the place was full when we arrived at noon) and strolled through the patio(?) area to the actual(?) restaurant.  That set up is strange itself; especially with no indication of where I'm headed.  We were quickly seated in close quarters with our other lovely brunch eating brethren.  Service was fine.  We're easy guests, and our waiter was more than tolerant with the +1 having not scoured the menu to make sure he would like something there like I had.  We both opted to go with the prix fixe; with most items hitting the halfway point, 28 bucks seemed great for including an appetizer and cocktail.\\n\\nMy bellini was done right.  Fancy style, making all the schnapps (ha! sorry).  The appetizer of granola with a lil' yogurt that seemed more like cream cheese fatty goodness than the very vanilla yoplait lite I typically let myself have; a sprinkling of berries hit the spot.  Sweet enough for me--maple-y and rich--and didn't even for a second seem like someone poured some Nature Valley in a bowl.  The +1 ordered the cinnamon killed polenta and couldn't get enough.. so I barely got any.\\n\\nOur entrees though are a different story.  +1 got the mushroom and goat omelet with his little roasted potatoes and his little sausage and his little toast and was all happy enough with it. I am not so easy, I guess.  The brioche French toast sounded great.  Caramelized pear! Sold!  I received, next to a large, meaty chicken sausage link, a few small pieces of fruit and one slice of French toast.  How is that a thing?  Maybe this is the husky child in me, but I was not expecting one slice.  Luckily with the prix fixe, there was no way I would have been able to eat more than one, but really.  If I had only ordered that at some double-digit menu price, I would not be a happy camper.\\n\\nOverall, really, it was fine.  The food was actually better than I make it sound; it just didn't hit the expectations everyone had set for me.  The hungry girl me will always require more than one slice of sugar bread.  Curiosity of dinner with reservations might bring me back if I don't want to make the trek elsewhere with February arctic conditions again, maybe.\",\n",
       " u'I came for the Sunday brunch prix fixe menu - you get one appetizer and entree with a classy cocktail. I made reservations online a few weeks in advance, and the restaurant, even with decent indoor and large outdoor (with heat lamp) seating, became pretty packed. \\n\\nFor the appetizer, I was able to try the Granola, Fruit and Yogurt, the Tomato & Basil Bisque, and the Mushroom and Celery Root Puree, and all were equally delicious. The mushroom and celery root puree I was a little wary of, but it was delicious. \\n\\nFor the entree, I tried Steak and Egg, Sea Scallop Fry, and the Braised Lamb & Eggs. The portions were substantial and the flavors were all there. The runny yolk with the steak and lamb were glorious. They also have other standard brunch entrees, such as a benedict and waffles, but I felt like this was something you can get anywhere.\\n\\nOverall, really satisfied with the brunch we had. The outdoor seating was beautiful, and the heat lamps kept us pretty warm in the winter.',\n",
       " u\"It was funny because my boyfriend and I came here spontaneously -- we were going to stop by a pizza place for a slice, but decided to stop into Casbah instead. Totally different atmosphere and dining experience. It's a pretty romantic setup. When we went (around 8pm on a Thursday), there weren't too many people there.  I felt like the service was good. They didn't treat us like second rate citizens even though we were in casual clothes and I was carrying my backpack (typical student outfit).\\n\\nWe had the tuna tartare, which was lovely. Then, we tried the duck with gnocchi and spinach which was also delicious and a great blend of flavors. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, which was just ok. It looked pretty, but the flavors weren't anything special. Oh, they also had really nice house made bread that came to our table warm, crusty and crunchy outside and soft inside.\\n\\nOverall, Casbah was a good experience, but I'm not drooling as I think back to the meal. I'm not sure I'll go back because there are other places to try and the price point makes it somewhere I wouldn't just go to on a normal day.\",\n",
       " u'My introduction as a youth (dating back AWAYS) to gourmet and class.  15 years later, still delivers the goods.  Cheers!',\n",
       " u\"It is DUE time to update this review. Why? Because I had a phenomenal brunch here, and it totally restored my faith in not only Casbah, but Big Burrito. I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!\\n\\nI love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups. \\n\\nThen came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs. \\n\\nI couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread. How nice is that?\\n\\nNow I'm excited to try other meals here again!\",\n",
       " u\"I like this place. It's 5 min walk from my home to Casbah and now we're finally here. The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too. The texture is between ice creme and fudge, really nice and smooth. My friend said that she could have another two of this. In general, Casbah is a nice restaurant with great food and thoughtful service, 5 stars!\",\n",
       " u'Fantastic dinner. Every or of the food and drink was exceptional --- made it worth the extra money you will spend here. Great for a special evening. Can be a bit noisy inside but again, the food overcomes all potential downfalls!',\n",
       " u\"Parking: Street parking or valet. \\n\\nInitial thoughts: I've heard this place had great food, and since I was quite hungry, I was excited. \\n\\nWait time: We had a reservation, so we were seated right away. \\n\\nService: Great - the waiters were attentive and made sure we were enjoying our meal and had our water glasses filled. \\n\\nAppetizers/Small dishes: Cheese tasting with 5 cheese - it was so tiny. Not worth the price. The cheese were interesting, but for the cost I expected more than just a few small slices of bread, a few slices of cheese, and a dollop of jam. \\n\\nMain dish: Long Island duck - TOO SALTY. I thought the duck itself was cooked well, but as I was eating it I had to constantly drink water to make up for the taste. There were a few measly pieces of gnocchi. There was no lavender flavor or kumquats. I would recommend getting something other than this dish if you do go. \\n\\nDrinks: We ordered a bottle of Riesling, which was good but nothing special. \\n\\nCost: The main dishes were all around $30-35. For the cost, I expected the flavor to wow me, but really I just need a lot of water to drink. \\n\\nAmbience: We sat in the part of the restaurant that was under a tent-like structure. It was a bit chilly, but they had the heated lights on. It is dark, so don't expect to take any good photos. \\n\\nOverall: Just okay. I wish I could give it more stars, but really it was disappointing. After that unsettling duck main dish, I'm not sure If I'm willing to try this place again.\",\n",
       " u\"Had my first dinner there last evening.  Excellent service, very attentive and pleasant.The bread came warm with sea salt butter served and another spread both were delicious.  I ordered the lamb loin and it was outstanding.  Just the right portion size, the potatoes were beyond delicious.  I don't normally have desert but I ordered a chocolate raspberry bread pudding that was also wonderful.  I could only eat half so I took the rest home.\\n\\n\\nBar was very nice and seats comfortable and the atmosphere was casual too formal.

       " u'Stopped by in the afternoon for a quick bite to eat. The main dining room is closed in the afternoon before dinner between 2:30-5pm, but you can still order from a small menu at the bar. They were very friendly and accommodating. We tried the scallops and flatbread with hummus/baba ghanoush/red pepper muhummara, both were fantastic and well done. Would definitely go again to try something from their regular menu!',\n",
       " u'I have heard much about Casbah being one of the best eateries in the 412. I went on their pasta special and got the ricotta ravioli and the short rib ravioli. The ricotta was the second most expensive dish on that menu and we received two saggy, bland pouches of what tasted like a microwaved lunchable. The short rib was doused in a gravy-like sauce that overwhelmed any taste or subtleties that may have existed. Heavy and bland. Not generally what I go out to eat for. \\n\\nThe service was also extremely slow. 20 minutes to get our bread and 50 to get our appetizers.',\n",
       " u'Pasta fest should be called deception fest. We got an email inviting us to come to pasta fest thinking it would be regular portions at a discounted price. WRONG it was smaller portions at a higher price. I never felt so ripped off. $15 for one meatball and three bites of pasta. The server warned us about the small portion but wow . You got me this time but never again.',\n",
       " u'I signed up for my big burrito birthday coupon and knew Casbah was the place I wanted to go to use it! Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn\\'t a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn\\'t thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). \\n\\nNext, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entr\\xe9e, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being saut\\xe9ed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli\\'s and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch! \\n\\nService was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about. This might be one of my new \"special occasion\" spots-  and we are planning to come back next month for my boyfriend\\'s birthday (I need that pork chop in my life again, stat!).',\n",
       " u\"You can't go wrong with Casbah. Meals and service are deliciously consistent, yet there's enough experimentation to keep things interesting. My dad and I visited this week, specifically, for Pastafest and - as usual - the meal was nothing short of spectacular. \\n\\nWe began at the bar where I mentioned a favorite drink no longer on the menu: the Malbec margarita. The bartender was quick to dig out the recipe box and whip one up to sweet and sour perfection. Happy hour prices make a stop at this bar one Shadyside's best options for higher end post-work cocktails. \\n\\nSeated in the bright (though slightly stuffy patio), we began with Casbah's exceptional calamari. Lightly breaded and fried, the squid was tender and deliciously sauced with a garlicky aioli and the sweet and sour Italian agrodolce (ahhhmazzzing), the combination made for a crave-worthy bite. \\n\\nPastafest provided tasting portions of some old favorites and chef's creations. We shared three: \\n\\nGemelli, jumbo lump crab, sweet corn, guanciale, tarragon: sweet and bright, this dish was summer on a plate.  \\n\\nDoppio Ravioli, eggplant puree, goat cheese, sweet & spicy peppers, marinated fennel: creamy and rich, the sweet and spicy pepper sauce was just the acidic kick the ravoli needed to balance perfectly.  \\n\\nSheep's Milk Gnudi, pork rag\\xf4ut, baby kale, grilled scallions, orange sea salt, extra virgin olive oil: gnudi is an all-time favorite and the pork ragout was incredibly tender, a gussied up version of BBQ and pasta salad.\\n\\nWe ended our meal with the milk cake which was moist and sweet and lovely with the last few sips of wine. The thing about Casbah? I always leave wanting more, which always keeps me coming back.\",\n",
       " u\"My husband and I love Casbah. We had our first date here, he proposed here, we had our first anniversary dinner at Casbah not to mention numerous brunches and dinners over the last 5 or so years. We are big fans of all the Big Burrito restaurants, but we have been especially pleased with the service and food at Casbah. Since they added valet service, that's one more thing you don't have to worry about. Very good portions sizes, well prepared food, and let me emphasize again- phenomenal service. Use your birthday coupon or have your special night out here!\",\n",
       " u\"This restaurant came recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed! The hummus appetizer was delicious, as well as the English Pea Risotto (vegetarian for my daughter) and the famous Cioppino. I was also recommended a flight of Rose wine when I couldn't decide between them. They were all delicious! As a dessert we shared the strawberry rhubarb croustade which melted in your mouth! As a nice touch the kitchen had written Happy Birthday on the plate since it was my daughter's 17'th birthday! We will definitely go back when in the area, and I would recommend the restaurant to all my friends. We were sitting in the basement, which was nice and quiet, but their outdoor seating looked very cool as well (more noisy).\",\n",
       " u'My boyfriend recently received very exciting news and wanted to go out on the town to celebrate it. My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that\\'s another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn\\'t question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot. \\n\\nI began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill \"Harbison\"; Vermont, cow\\'s milk, soft; the Sardinia \"Calcagno\"; Italy, sheep\\'s milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon \"Leonora\"; Spain, goat\\'s milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn\\'t offer if I\\'d like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer.',\n",
       " u\"This place's reputation as a high-end restaurant is entirely undeserved. Every single entr\\xe9e my party ordered was oversalted and bland. And for the price I was expecting much, much more. If you're looking for quality food for $25-35 per plate, go to Meat & Potatoes.\",\n",
       " u\"Casbah is great! They always over deliver; whether it be the service, the food presentation or the quality, freshness and uniqueness of each dish starting with the appetizer all the way to dessert they never disappoint. Their menu is constantly changing so you never know what you'll get each time you go. \\nI also love the atmosphere & eating outside on their patio. \\nCasbah is a must try (and ask to eat on the patio)!\",\n",
       " u'4.5 stars. My husband and I went here a few days ago. We liked the outdoor area that was \"open tent\" - when we come back we would like to sit out there (weather permitting, of course). The beginning bread basket and goat cheese/salted butter was fantastic! We started with the calamari, which had a delicious lemon aioli sauce coupled with an Italian sweet and sour sauce. The combo was delectable! My husband had the duck, which was juicy and tender. I had the cavatelli, which was fantastic on a rainy day. My white wine flight was wonderful! We will be visiting again!',\n",
       " u\"I like this place very much, and find it to be reasonably vegetarian-friendly. You have to know what to order, though, to get the best deal, because some things are just plain overpriced.\\n\\nYou should definitely stop in for lunch and get the Piccola Gusto menu - it is a great deal and is plenty of food. You get to try so many awesome things, and it's possible for every component to be vegetarian! It is a way better deal than ordering any one item - they are pretty expensive.\\n\\nI've also been to a dinner party catered there (in the nice outdoor tent area), and they had a great antipasti platter and various pastas we could try. There were actually multiple vegetarian options, which I really appreciated.\\n\\nI would give this place a 5, but it would be nice if the vegetarian options experienced as much rotation/creativity as the meat ones. I love the mafaldine, but it is consistently the only veg pasta on the menu. But service, ambience, and food are all great.\",\n",
       " u\"Amazing. My family and an out of town family (super foodies/winos) ate here once and ended up spending over 3 hours at our table, not because service was slow, just because it was a nice environment to chat away an entire evening. \\nWe had tuna tartare that was amazing. I had halibut for my main dish that was incredible. \\nI didn't pay so I'm not sure what the bill ended up being but I'm sure it dented someone's wallet. \\nWhile waiting for our entire party to show up we hung around the bar which was very swanky but not in an overly fancy way. \\nService was perfect. Would love to go back.\",\n",
       " u\"I got my Big Burrito birthday meal voucher in the mail, and I couldn't decide which place to try.  I am a huge fan of Eleven and Mad Mex, but I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had previously sampled Casbah's food when they catered the dinner for Quantum Theater's production of Tamara.  I enjoyed the food at that event so I settled on coming here.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of Casbah is really cute.  It's slightly upscale, but you will still feel comfortable in nice jeans.  There is a Mediterranean theme to the atmosphere, but I don't know that the food is themed that way, despite what Yelp says.\\n\\nI ordered the Lamb Macaroni and Cheese because I am a Mac and Cheese addict.  The portion was exactly lunch sized, and it came with a small salad.  The salad was really just a spring mix of lettuce with an oil dressing, but it tasted good.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  Plenty of lamb and lots of cheese.  It was on the creamy side of the mac and cheese scale.  I would order it again, but I would also like to try other things on the menu.  My friends ordered a sandwich and one ordered a bowl of soup.  The sandwich eater felt her turkey sandwich was pretty standard, but it was a turkey sandwich.  The soup eater was a fan.  Again, I plan to come back and test other things.\\n\\nAs a side note: The catered meal I previously tried was family-style chicken with potatoes and veggies, I believe.  It was good but not what I would expect after seeing the menu for them to serve.  I think you are safe to try just about anything here, really.\\n\\nThe only odd thing was that the servers really seemed to be fighting for tables.  Everyone was trying to get our drink and food orders, to the point of it being a touch aggressive.  Not a big deal just an observation.\",\n",
       " u'Very good atmosphere, excellent service, food was also wonderful. Had the ricotta cavetelli and it was great. Meatballs and cheeses were great. Was a very good time and would definitely go back. Cocktails were unique and tasty.',\n",
       " u'We were excited to go to casbah after hearing good things from locals and having gone to mad Mex, which was truly great TexMex food. despite trying to be optimistic, we really left unimpressed. here\\'s the breakdown:\\ncocktails/drinks- the list was unimaginative and wife\\'s cocktail was neither refreshing, not very strong. the beers offered were not great, one was flat: 3/10\\ngnuti- this was somewhat tasty and rich, with well cooked chunks of lobster, however nothing I\\'ll remember tomorrow: 7/10\\noctopus- the list of ingredients and fact that it is a Mediterranean restaurant makes you think this would be light and fresh w a salty kick from the prosciutto. but it seemed to be cooked with the prosciutto and/or brown sugar and was overcooked, a heavy lumbering dish that not even fennel could make up for. this was a big disappointment. 2/10\\nhalibut-  the fish was well cooked, but the dish was generic, not exciting nor offensive, forgettable. 4/10\\nCasericcha (sp?)- this really was the standout. The scallops were cooked well and it was chock full of crab. It was very rich. Nothing about the preparation was special, and it wasnt spicy and it was green with pesto so the name red pepper is somewhat of a misnomer, but for the pure weight of fresh lump crab makes this dish 8/10, even with a pretty high price for pasta of $35.\\nDessert- milk sponge cake- small and fairly dry, which again, with name \"sponge\" one would be disappointed to expect a moist cake. 3/10.\\nservice- the service was fine, not amazing, seemed like waiter was a little too busy for the higher prices of food. although the ambience on porch was nice, they seemed to have a hard time regulating the temperature, with various times of sweat building on the brow, throughout the meal. 5/10\\ntotal: 30/7=4.something and given the price, how good everything looked on the menu and the disappointment of anticipated greatness, I\\'m rounding down. \\nbig burrito is a shooting 50% (props to mad Mex), curious to see how they do in the rubber match.',\n",
       " u'We went to Casbah this past Saturday.   It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entr\\xe9e up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.\\n\\nOur reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.\\n\\nDuring our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entr\\xe9es came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.  \\n\\nAt this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was \"on the house, and it was their/his fault.\"  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entr\\xe9e was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can\\'t complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn\\'t that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.  Live and learn.',\n",
       " u\"Lovely place for delicious Mediterranean food and fine service. We went here for a friend's birthday and Casbah was a festive environment. This place is fine dining but it's not stuffy. I tried to keep my fork and knife and the server made jokes about how that's not their style. In addition, the patio is a nice romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains.\\n\\nFirst let me talk about the drinks. My husband's moscow mule was a little stronger than most places would make it, but they do have the copper mugs. Some places cheap out on that but not Casbah. I had a delicious house Malbec but then switched over to a Grenache and Carignan blend. It was the first time I've had such a mix and I was so happy with my choice that I ended up ordering another glass. It was a wonderfully rich and bold (but not bitter) combination that was a superb pairing to our dinner entrees.\\n\\nFor starters I had the octopus, which was ok but not great. There was too much of a char flavor so it was almost burnt. The tuna however was an explosion of flavor. It was fresh and very flavorful.\\n\\nFor my main dish, I had the duck. I double checked with the waitress when I ordered to make sure the skin was crispy and it was indeed. The meat was perfectly tender and the sauce was sweet and savory.\\n\\nEveryone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The lamb shank is so large you need to get a takeaway bag. \\n\\nThe birthday boy's wife arranged for an ice cream before we got to dinner. The waitress seamlessly distracted us with dessert menus while she got the cake ready, so she really added to the birthday fun.\\n\\nAll in all, this place really impressed. It can be  fun, romantic or celebratory depending on the occasion.\",\n",
       " u'Nice outdoor patio dining area.  Short rib ravioli was great.  The halibut was also very good.',\n",
       " u'This is my favorite big burrito restaurant. The food is consistently good, and the service is as well. I often have two or three starters as my meal. They are quite interesting and well made. Their pasta dishes are quite good as well as some of the meat courses.',\n",

Sweet niblets. I had a glass of Michel-Schlumberger Pinot Noir that was so good that my eyes actually crossed. CRAZY good. And the rest of the selection was just as impressive. \\n\\nWe were served a basket of hot-from-the-oven bread with sea-salted butter and this otherworldly strained Greek yogurt stuff with lemon that was so yummy I seriously considered licking the plate. Seemed reasonable at the time. \\n\\nAppetizers were flatbread with hummus, baba ghanouj, and red pepper muhummara (sublime) and veal/pork meatballs with crispy Brussels sprouts that earned a resounding \"OMG!\" from the young uns.\\n\\nThe girl child ate--and swooned over--short rib ravioli, the boy devoured (and waxed rhapsodic over) his orecchiette with Elysian Farms chicken, and I lost myself in (and have pledged my troth to) the best cioppino I\\'ve ever eaten (San Francisco, eat your heart out).\\n\\nBut wait! There\\'s more!\\n\\nDessert. Holy yum balls. Kid #1 had raspberry-chocolate bread pudding with cr\\xeame Anglaise, Kid #2 had the chocolate cheeesecake bombe. Both kids were over the moon and doing things like pledging to clean their rooms every day (that must\\'ve been SOME dessert). \\n\\nOn top of all this, the service was AH-mazing. Every person who came to the table was funny and smiling and bending over backward to make the meal all it should have been.

       " u\"I stayed at two different apartments in their 5909 building. They were good with maintenance stuff but tried to screw you over wherever they can to get the extra money from you. The lady, Sherry (who is the owner's daughter and run the management company) is very disrespectful-- especially after you've signed the lease.\\n\\nI signed a lease stating that the apartment will be available for move in on August 1st and she yelled at me for asking her for the key on August 1st-- saying that I should take into account that it needs to be cleaned-- that's NOT how leases work. When the lease states a move-in date, it literally means that. I didn't have the apartment until August 6th but until then they only had the carpet changed. The apartment was not cleaned. I had to request them to give me a cleaning coupon and prorate the rent for August for me-- they did both but nothing makes up for the urgency I was in since my sick brother needed the apartment urgently and I had conveyed that to her before signing the lease-- that and the fact that she was arrogant because she knew we were pretty limited in our options. \\n\\nAlso, they tried to squeeze in every penny from our security deposit. My ex-roommate had magnets on the fridge that left a couple of pink stains on it. They charged us $531 for that-- the fridge worked fine.\\n\\nIf you didn't have to deal with Sherry the place won't be a bad idea to stay but her attitude problem and unprofessionalism makes it really hard. Melita is a much more professional person to speak to but she only works for Sherry.\\n\\nThe apartments are not bad but it's very poorly managed.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'ve lived with them for 4 years in two different buildings.  First building for about 3 years and the second building 1 year.\\n\\nFirst, their customer service might suck.  They have tried to improve it over the years.  They\\'re are friendlier now though it is the fake kind.  Their rudeness shows through sometimes. For the time I\\'ve been with them, I\\'ve seen all of them at the office talk in a rude manner.  Sheri, the woman that runs the place, is the one I mainly dealt with.  She can get snippy on the phone.  She\\'s the type that always look like she\\'s frustrated and tries her best not to go bitchy on you.  These are just small examples.  I\\'ve been with them 4 years and it\\'s been overall fine.  They\\'re straight forward, and again have been working on their politeness recently.  They have been pleasant the last few times I\\'ve visit them.  The maintenance staff is friendly too.\\n\\nSome of their buildings are pretty run down.  Both my apartments have fake fire places.  I personally think they\\'re disgusting.  They\\'re the \"cover it over\" kind of maintenance.  My first building, everything was covered over with paint or caulk.  Mold grew through the caulk in my bathroom.  However, at my new place, they renovated the apartment so everything is relatively new and clean.  No mold in my current bathroom.  You just have to find the right building.  If their apartment was in the same quality as my first apartment, I would never move back in. \\n\\nThey always responded to maintenance calls.  There has been times where I came home and realize maintenance has been there without any notice.  However, it seems they\\'re leaving door hangers now to let you know they were there.  I like that they accept pets but a deposit is required.  Their apartment has AC.  My first building had heat included.  My 2nd building has heat but the vent is so small it won\\'t heat the entire apartment.  They do respond to neighbor complaints.  We got people playing drums at odd hours, reported them, and the drumming stopped.  \\n\\nWhen I left my first apartment, I got my deposit, and my pet deposit back no problem.  It did take a month after I already left but that was clearly stated on the sheet that give us.  My current apartment has been renovated.  New cabinets, carpet, bathroom redone, new windows with screen.  It\\'s good enough.\\n\\nThey\\'re strictly business.  The apartment I live in now is livable.  I like my area of Friendship.  I doubt anyone will live here long term anyway.  Rent is competitive.  Overall, I\\'d recommend them.',\n",
       " u'In September of last year, 2014, I had been struggling to locate a comfortable, beautiful, safe, and affordable one bedroom apartment in the Shadyside area. Anyone who is anyone understands that with much of Shadyside and it\\'s surrounding areas, finding something with all four criteria is more than tough.\\n\\nLuckily, while driving around searching for \"for rent\" signs, I stumbled onto 415 S. Aiken Ave. This 7 unit building is very unique. With two apartments with balconies on the top floor, exposed brick in some, and brand new renovations in others, there is so much to love about the place I had spent my last year. Rent was more than affordable, and gas and water are included in the rent. Electric bills are barely relevant at 30-50$ per month. Plenty of space for one person, and a giant closet for storage (seriously, it\\'s huge!). Yard and building is very nicely maintained, a lot for parking out back is just enough space, and the neighbors and their puppies keep mostly to themselves, but are all very very kind!\\n\\nNow in regards to the company: Herbert Halsband properties has been nothing but kind, courteous, and respectful since day one. I\\'ve had quite a bit of interaction with the folks in the leasing office, as well as with the maintenance crew at my building. First and foremost, when I first accepted this apartment, it needed gutted and renovated. The staff that is hired by the company to remodel and perform maintenance on the buildings are WONDERFUL people, with lots of respect and a sense of humor to boot. Secondly, Sherry, Melita, as well as the rest of the staff over in the leasing office on Shady Ave, were such a pleasure through my entire lease. They understood and answered any questions or concerns that came up throughout the process (although concerns were few and far between). Not to mention, every conversation I\\'ve had with Sherry or Melita (the folks I speak with most often) has been such a joy... I truly couldn\\'t have asked for a more overall perfect experience for my first apartment. \\n\\nI would whole heartedly recommend looking into the options that Herbert Halsband Properties has to offer. Give Sherry or Melita a ring at the office if you\\'re searching, and I\\'m sure they\\'ll find you something wonderful.',\n",
       " u\"Working weekend shifts at work are kind of annoying, but the perks can be sweet! One being free lunch! This previous weekend my boss bought us lunch from Pizza Perfecta. \\n\\nAfter ordering pizza at home twice that week (we DID NOT feel like cooking), I decided to go with a grilled chicken salad. Meh. I'm not saying it was bad, but it wasn't really that great either. I thought they could have dressed it up some more. It was loaded with (too much) cheese and it melted due to the fries being warm, making the top of the salad kind of gross. Underneath the melted cheese was the lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cucumber. I guess this is all standard for a salad, but it really just didn't impress me. Plus, I thought the chicken tasted pre-cooked which should be a big no-no for restaurants. One perk, however, was the size as it was pretty big! However, for $8.00, I felt it was a little steep. \\n\\nI also had a slice of pizza (I can't resist pizza) and it was comparable to any other pizza shop. \\n\\nService is very good, though! I placed the order and the employee I spoke with was very friendly. They had it delivered in time as well. \\n\\nI'm not complaining because it was a free lunch, but I would never order myself.\",\n",
       " u\"I started out trying this pizza at a friend's house when she had it delivered. I loved the pizza both times and wanted to know where it was from. Finally, I went over and had it on my own. So good! I get extra cheese, which is heavenly. I find this pizza to be less greasy than others I have tried around town and it's satisfying. I love the sauce and the crust. It's not too much or too little. Just the right amount. The interior is fairly small and best for take-out. They have a display fridge with a few desserts. I've tried their cannoli and it's my favorite. There's also bottled drinks available for purchase.\",\n",
       " u\"I looooove their pizza! They bake my cheese with ricotta and tomato extra for a crispier crust. I'm a crust girl, and theirs is perfect. I always get a salad too but they continue to disappoint on that end. The lettuce is often brown and never crisp. I hope they get it together soon or else I will just stick to pizza. Fast delivery and good price :)\",\n",
       " u'I order from Pizza Perfecta all the time, and they always turn out to be excellent. I love the crust, and their vegetarian options on the menu are pretty good.',\n",
       " u'Fresh, prepared quickly, and always delicious! Everything tastes like it is from scratch--recommend the hoagies, salads, and specialty pastas. Spinach feta and Mediterranean pizzas have amazing crusts!',\n",
       " u'Really yum Vegetarian Pizza!',\n",
       " u\"This is a 5-star neighborhood pizza delivery joint. I've ordered from here multiple times, and the quality was consistent and the delivery was timely and friendly. The food comes hot, and they never forget to give utensils, condiments and napkins.\\n\\nI've ordered the Wings with Garlic and Parm, which comes in a oven-safe container for leftovers. The Buffalo fries are great as well- and if you top it with cheese you also get the aluminum container. We all know food tastes better when its reheated in the oven.\\n\\nThe Chicken Ranchero Pizza is great, but I feel pretty guilty about eating it, so I just order regular pizza with random toppings that I'm in the mood for. My other favorite item is the Cheesy Breadsticks.\\n\\nConsistent, delicious quality with reliable delivery=5 stars. I've walked by the store itself- it's a takeout place.\",\n",
       " u\"Delivered to our hotel late after a day of family stuff. Hit the spot pretty well. Only wish I'd ordered a bigger one.\",\n",
       " u\"This is hands down the best pizza place in Pittsburgh.  It has a modest exterior, but you can't judge a book by it's cover.  This used to be my regular pizza place when visiting family in Pittsburgh and now I make it a point to go back whenever I'm in town.  Coming from the NY/NJ area which is pizza and Italian food heaven, you can say I'm picky when it comes to my pizza and I often find it difficult to find good pizza outside of the area where I live, but Pizza Perfectta totally delivers with great taste every time.  The sandwiches and side orders I've tried have all been great as well.  Top it all off with reasonable prices and friendly service, and these guys got me as a loyal customer for life whenever I'm in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u'This is really good food...I just order a delivery which was really fast and hot..the pizza is good a long with the hoagie which can feed four people...if your looking for good pizza this is the place to go....',\n",
       " u'Congratulatory pizza delivery for moving my friend in from California! Delivery was on time, took about 30 minutes on a Friday night so not bad. Good pizza for a decent price! I hope my friend keeps going back!',\n",
       " u\"Easily the most delicious pizza in the Shadyside. Their delivery service is always on time, and most of the time it's early! I think there's only been one instance where I was waiting the full time that they had given for the delivery. They've got tons of topping options, and they are competitively priced compared to some of the other pizza joints in the area.\",\n",
       " u'Tillies!! If you like Italian food, you should be eating at Tillies! I am reviewing Pittsburgh area restaurants because I live here. If you want good food and great service, go to Tillies! Get the house Italian dressing on your salad, try the zucchini, and any dish that you order that has spaghetti sauce or meat sauce is a WINNER!!! Chicken parm is delicious and so is the Marsala!! Enjoy!!',\n",
       " u\"I've been to about ~50 pizza places in Pittsburgh and this is one I would not go back to. Pizza is pretty bland and there is nothing remarkable about it.\",\n",
       " u\"On the positive side, the delivery was pretty quick, given I ordered during the dinner rush, where I would consider under an hour to be pretty exceptional. After that, the food was pretty meh. The pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Given the relative quick delivery, it was on the cold side upon arrival. Also, I had ordered a fried pickle appetizer. It was clearly a frozen appetizer, so I knew what to expect, but this also arrived cold and soggy. All and all not a terribly positive experience given the vast wealth of take-out options in the area.\",\n",
       " u'Great pizza. They sent us the wrong bread sticks at first (regular instead of cheesy), but quickly fixed it without issue.',\n",
       " u'They claimed on their website that they have \"the best wings in town\". As a seeker of good wings, let me tell you about my adventure with this place. \\n\\nEverything started fine with our order of 24 wings with three separate sauces for 3 eaters. The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery. Here\\'s the catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain. They were, I kid you not, so bland that I wasn\\'t sure what I was eating. They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should\\'ve just settled with a bottle of sirracha. \\n\\nThe deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point. But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was. The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little. It looked nice, but didn\\'t taste that great. \\n\\nSo after 1 hour and 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces and a cannoli... we have 3 very unhappy customers. The wings were the most mediocre wings I have ever tasted. I will NOT order here again for the wings NOR will I recommend it to the fellow wings connoisseurs out there. Final verdict: MOST MEDIOCRE wings in town!',\n",
       " u\"I've been bringing my cats here for about 30 years. The vets and techs are fantastic. They treat my animals and me with patience, kindness and respect. Dr. Schroth saw my latest two cats through their final illnesses. She was incredibly empathetic. I felt very comfortable asking her questions. The front office staff is also great. I can't say enough good things about this place.\",\n",
       " u\"There are so few legit delis in Pittsburgh, so finding one is a big deal. Frick Park Market is a hidden gem tucked away in Point Breeze near one of the roundabouts and a few blocks from the park itself. They serve a variety of ice creams and snacks in addition to their house-made sandwiches. All of the lunchmeat is Boar's Head, which is a top of the line brand that tastes absolutely wonderful. You can pretty much customize your sandwich however you'd like or choose one from the pre-made menu board. Either way you'll end up with a treat! My one complaint is that I wish the bread was a wee bit sturdier...it gets soggy easily. It would be nice to see them using Trader Joe's quality bread that stands up to all the wonderful sandwich fillings a little better. Until then I'll continue to remake my leftover half a sandwich on fresh bread at home. It's a small price to pay for such a nice deli close to my favorite park in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nI must say a word about the kind staff who work here as well. I purchased a ginger beer last time I stopped in, and it had a twist off cap. Those things suck to open with bare hands. The lady behind the counter gave me a napkin to twist it off with before I'd even asked. So sweet! Thoughtfulness like that goes a long way with me.\",\n",
       " u'We recently stayed at a small place a few doors away from this market and came in for coffee every morning.  The owners are very nice. They have great coffee & biscotti.  Good selection of cold cuts and pastries.  Everyday the was a different, delicious smelling homemade soup cooking.',\n",
       " u\"This market is a gem alright.  We were ready to walk right past the place without even stopping but the owners greeted us warmly as we approached.   Originally, we were looking for a pizza/bar place but the owners told us it was about 10 blocks away.  They showed us their menu and we were more than pleased with the wonderful choices. Everything is freshly prepared.  They even feature a monthly dinner menu geared for cook's night off.  The selections look fantastic.  I cant wait to make a return visit.  This is the perfect spot to pick up something for the First Friday concerts held at the Frick.  Cash only but they do have an ATM inside the market.\",\n",
       " u\"Used to love the Co-op despite its flaws.  Continuous turnover, especially at higher levels, poor communication to customers, blatantly hostile/condescending attitude from some staff.   All been going on for years. There was some improvement for awhile, but it has gotten worse.  A few individual employees are pleasant and competent, but the organization overall has some serious issues with ethics/transparency.   They're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas.  Pittsburgh has many choices for healthy food - farmers markets and CSAs - and that's where we purchase much of our food now.  Suggest you do the same.\",\n",
       " u'I had driven by East End Food Co-Op over 100x throughout the last 3 years and would frequently comment, \"I need to check it out!\" Well, finally, a couple weeks ago, I decided to randomly swing by the co-op.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with a soy allergy last year, so I was truly like a little kid in a candy store at East End Food Co-Op. There are so many options that not only accommodate my annoying food allergy but also support incredible local businesses.\\n\\nFor my first East End visit, I snagged several items, including incredible locally-made challah bread, three types of flavorful locally-harvested honey, cognac fig cheese, and my favorite amy\\'s pizza in pesto, a flavor that I have never found elsewhere. Thankfully, I was shopping without a basket or cart, or I would have spent well over $100 on my first trip. Instead, I was trying to balance all my great finds in my arms, which limited my purchases.\\n\\nMy one warning about East End... don\\'t expect Aldi or Trader Joe\\'s prices here. Like Whole Foods, you\\'ll be spending $50 or more on just a bad or two of groceries. Just remember that you\\'re supporting multiple local businesses when shopping here, and you\\'ll leave feeling fulfilled about your money spent!',\n",
       " u\"The co-op is an invaluable resource for Pittsburgh. \\n\\nFirst of all, the selection is fantastic. No matter what kind of health-conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo - they've got what you need. My favorite items here that you can't really find many other places are raw milk (legal in PA, woo!) and the local meats. The prices on the meat here are higher than most butchers in the area, but on par with the lesser quality meats at Whole Foods - choose your co-op!\\n\\nI seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high. For example, I recently purchased mushrooms at $1.99 per lb. and strawberries for $2.50 per lb., which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store. Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.\\n\\nWhen I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique products. I also love that you can fill a jar and buy it right at the store - most other bulk sections in the 'Burgh don't have this.\\n\\nAll in all, I like being able to go into a store and not have to sift through the produce to see if it's what I want (organic, local) because it all is! Naturally, they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not grow here, but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method.\\n\\nThe employees are always friendly and helpful as well. The only terrible thing about this place is the fact that there is almost NEVER parking - I've parked in the lot maybe  ten times out of the ~40 or so times that I've shopped here. I don't mind the walk down, but with heavy bags in my hand, the walk up the street can be tough!\",\n",
       " u\"Where do I start??  i LOVE the East End Food Co-op!  One of my colleagues introduced me to the co-op and I was super skeptical, but when I went back by myself I was immediately in love.  I originally went the first time to get some essential oils, but left with that and then some! I've been back quite a few times since then and I can't get enough!  I get a little overwhelmed when I go in if I dont have a very specific list (and even then, if you're not familiar with the products or choices, it can be confusing) but I do love to go in and just explore.. It's really a little piece of heaven for any health food lover.  I love their selections of dairy products and meats as well.. theres also a great supplement section.. I could go on and on, but you get it.  This place is a diamond in the rough and I love it!\",\n",
       " u\"If you are looking for hard to find healthy, organic, local food choices EEFC is the place to go.  The largest selection of seasonal fruits and vegetables and a juice bar that is fit for a king.  As a matter of fact that is the name of one of the amazing drinks.\\nIf you're looking for supplements, not only is the selection overwhelming  but the staff is capable of directing you to exactly which supplement you should consider to improve everything from hair loss to weight control or any topic Dr. Oz can muster up.  \\nEven discussion groups and mini classes are available and free to the public.\\nYou won't find this kind of service anywhere in the big box grocery stores.\\nThis is a member driven store but you don't have to be a member to shop there.  But if you do you will get even more savings potential.\",\n",
       " u\"A lesser known Whole Foods type of market with its own charm. \\n\\nThis place is pretty cool. There is so much to see and consider buying and I was intrigued at every corner. Listen to the reviews! Their selection of veggies, meats, fruits, frozen items, nuts and pretty much everything is amazing. You'll have so much fun exploring even if you're not looking to really buy anything. Boyfriend got dried mangoes and almond butter. A bit pricey, but we expected it to be. I got some food from the hot food and salad bars. They are small; you might find something you like. (Their mac n cheese is good!) They also have a juice bar, which I'd love to try next time. \\n\\nEast End Food Co-Op is an excellent place to do your weekly grocery shopping. You can find everything you need here and more.\",\n",

       " u\"Really wide selection of products to choose from.\\n\\nI understand that organic, local stuff is a premium purchase over conventional foods, and there is a huge community for these types of things to support the local food scene...But damned if I'm going to pay $8 for a pound of strawberries when I can get them for sale at Kroger for $1. Everything is 2-4x more expensive than conventional groceries. I can understand paying a little more, but I can't do that kind of mark-up.\",\n",
       " u'I love this place so much! It makes me want to redo the kitchen and bathroom floors in every apartment I rent with vintage tile.

And if you like Pinterest like I do... Give yourself even more time!\\n\\nFor today's adventure we had a specific task so we had to be what we call quick and dirty! No time for strolling and browsing. We got in, went to our specific area and set to work scavenging.  \\nWe got a bathroom vanity that only needs a little work for 30!!!

       " u\"I bought a 3 piece dorm set last week (bed,chest,desk and I was supposed to get a chair for the desk  ) I didn't have a truck when I bought it ,so they would store it for a week for $5. Not bad. When I paid the guy behind the counter said they were bundling sets in the back ,that they were all pretty much the same and decent quality,like the ones on the floor. Great ,thanks ,fine with me. \\nYesterday I rented a van to pick up my stuff. I had a  surly,rude guy take my receipt ,disappear for a while ,then come back and was really irritated that I hadn't moved my van. Well you didn't tell me to,and not sure how this process works. Then what really set him off is that I was there alone and he had to move my stuff. I am able to help move ,I just couldn't do it alone. But he grabbed piece by piece and got it on the truck. At the end I said thank you and I got a final glare. \\nGetting the stuff home ,it looked like they took the 3 most banged up pieces and bundled them for me. Not anything like the pieces on the floor. I get it it's used,it's as-is ,but did I have to get all 3 pieces in that condition and also be made to feel like a piece of crap because I need help ? \\nI try never to be that person who finds issues with everything,but I left there feeling embarrassed and upset. I didn't need to be treated that way ,\\nJust thought you should know.\",\n",
       " u\"Wow, well deserved 5 stars.\\n\\nI stopped in today to window shop a door (lol) I needed one for my bedroom and thought this would be the perfect spot after reading reviews.

Tons of room doors not to mention front doors, storm doors etc. I also seen a lot of toilets, sink fixtures, cabinets, dressers and so many lighting fixtures including beautiful chandeliers. I have no idea where all of this stuff would've ended if it wasn't for here, but I'm so glad the we have a store like this in the city! I'm excited to bring my fiance here and pick out a door.

If you go in just to look it could get quite overwhelming! We were with friends who were looking for a railing for their home and although they didn't find anything I know they'll go back again soon!\\n\\nThey have quite a bit of furniture on top of all kinds of finishes for both the interior and exterior of a space.\\n\\nTip: sign up for the weekly email that gives you inventory updates!\",\n",

       " u\"I had the pleasure of bringing a group of 15 young girls to the Climbing Wall recently. I had never climbed before, and neither had the girls, so I cannot comment much on the style or quality of the walls. But, the service we received was extraordinary and deserves 5 stars! \\n\\nWe had 3 belayers and another gentleman to keep the rotation going smoothly. We started by numbering off, to keep track of everyone. But, by the end of our time, the employees new each of the girls names! They were cheering every girl on and helping them to find the right holds. It was a very personal experience and the girls LOVED it!\\n\\nI found the experience to be affordable, friendly, and safe. I was never concerned about the safety of any one. If you're looking for a creative group activity or birthday party, I highly recommend The Climbing Wall!\",\n",
       " u'Wanted to leave an updated review for this place. My first review was too critical. This is a gym in Pittsburgh and you need to set your expectations accordingly. This gym cant go toe to toe with world class gyms like planet granite in sf or Seattle bouldering project in Washington, but given the size of the climbing community at Pittsburgh, this gym is pretty damn good. You can tell they are trying. They have made renovations to improve the gym and improved their setting quality and frequency. All in all, well done and keep up the good work.',\n",
       " u\"First of all, The Climbing Wall ha very helpful and knowledgeable staff who are eager to teach newcomers like myself. Some rock gyms I have been to are very elitist in that you feel like you're the one left out of some inner club, not this place. They are all about getting you interested and involved with climbing and the climbing community. \\n\\nThe walls them self are great with the perfect range of easy to challenging walls. They also change routes frequent enough to never get bored. \\n\\nPricing is also very good (especially if you are a student).\",\n",
       " u\"Admittedly, I am spoiled as I've been in Denver for the past 6 years where we have many climbing gyms to choose from. So my opinion is a little biased. \\n\\nIf you are into bouldering, The Climbing Wall is awesome. There is a HUGE bouldering room with tons of problems. \\n\\nBouldering, though, is not my jam. I love climbing. The climbing space is much smaller than bouldering and, compared to the gyms in Colorado, much shorter routes (5-8 moves to the top, 15-30 ft). There are ~30-40 routes that are changed regularly; rating of these routes are Easy+/- (5.5-5.7), Mod+/- (5.8-5.9), and Hard+/- (5.10+). \\n\\nCan't be too disappointed, though, because I was actually pleasantly surprised there was even a climbing gym here!\",\n",
       " u\"Great spot.  It's pretty cheap for a day pass, and shoe rentals are also reasonable (I'm not a seasoned climber, just fun to do once in awhile).  The employees are friendly and explain everything really well to first-timers.  \\n\\nThey change up the patterns seasonally, so it's been different every time I've gone.  It's definitely an awesome place to go on a rainy day and sneak in a good workout without realizing it (until the next day, ouch).\\n\\nThe only drawback, which isn't the establishment's fault, is sometimes the more serious groups of climbers will monopolize entire walls at a time.  Not cool, man.  But that happens everywhere; some people are just assholes.\",\n",
       " u'I bought the Groupon with a friend and we were both pleasantly surprised. Friendly, informative staff, even the clientele are friendly and insightful, almost light going to a friendly gym.',\n",
       " u'Really, really, really liked this place. Unfortunately only went bouldering so I can\\'t rate the top roping.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with the reasons why I couldn\\'t give it a full 5 stars: a lot of the holds are pretty greasy. Rather than using color coordinated holds, they\\'re marked off by tape patterns - but a lot of the routes have been there for a while so the tape is peeling off for half of them and/or 5 different routes overlap every hold so it\\'s pretty confusing often times. Lastly, the floor is fairly stiff, kinda like a gymnastics tumbling floor and there\\'s not enough crash padding to cover the whole floor. Lastly, the walls themselves are wood, rather than traditional bouldering walls that you can smear on.\\n\\nThat seems like a lot to improve on...so why still such a high rating? Simply put, route creativity. All sorts of walls: straight, overhangs of all angles and curves, 360 degree traversing routes, cracks, one through a low tunnel, chimneys, etc. there are some REALLY clever routes that really make you think how to do them. I loved the routes here and wish I had more than a day in Pittsburgh to come back.\\n\\nPrice wise, a little cheaper than other bouldering gyms I\\'ve been to. $14 for a typical admission, with reduced rates on returns for some people (like students). They have a \"ladies night\" that men can also get in to if they were a sports bra as a top. Mildly sexist, but hey, it\\'s all in good fun and the discount is extended to us so *shrug*\\n\\nBut anyway, loved this place. Would come back without hesitation.',\n",

       " u\"Wow!  We were looking forward to this for our anniversary, and we weren't disappointed!\\n\\nWe splurged with three starters:  grilled sardines, octopus, and pheasant terrine.  Each was lovelier than the next.  The terrine was particularly delicious, served with some sort of artisanal mustard and pickled onions on the side, and some nicely grilled bread.  The octopus was perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all, but buttery, nicely seasoned and presented.  The sardines were grill-hot with an ever so slightly charred and crispy skin, and the accompanying vegetables were barely warm, which actually made for a nice contrast.\\n\\nMain courses:  I had the shellfish stew from the menu.  All of the various seafood was perfectly cooked.  The broth could have had a bit more heat for my taste, but still: lovely.  The husband had one of the specials: cassoulet with venison osso buco. Heavenly, especially on a winter evening.  Gorgeous venison shanks and dome nicely roasted vegetables.\\n\\nAnother splurge: dessert.  We had the chocolate terrine and the key lime creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e, both of which were understated and luxurious.  Not fans of big, vulgar desserts, so these were right up our alley--rich, flavorful, just a nice sweet little end to a perfect meal.\\n\\nService was especially nice and attentive, but never intrusive.  Loved the shabby chic decor and the oddly shaped dining room.  Must be lovely in the summer with doors open in this quiet corner of Shadyside.  We'll definitely return to find out!\",\n",
       " u\"This place is just lovely! When you walk in, it's inviting and cozy. You'd never know it was an old garage. Plus, it's BYOB, so that's always a perk. Let's add in super friendly service, and it's a wine, I mean win. \\n\\nI had high hopes, especially with how much I loved the ambiance. I love tomato bisque, so I was excited to dive into that for a first course, but it was very strangely thin. When you imagine bisque, you imagine heavy cream used, but I believe it was broth based. I just wasn't digging it. \\n\\nBut then our starter came out, a goat cheese-stuffed puff pastry, and it was divine! Things were looking up! It was a delicious mix of cheese, plus light and airy puff pastry that we gobbled up. \\n\\nMe and a friend split two main courses; the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Pumpkin Coulis and the lamb burger with fontina and caramelized onions. I love lamb and I love squash, so this was the perfect splitting combo. I was pretty bummed when the lamb burger, while good lamb, didn't give off a lot of flavor. Which was surprising considering it also had caramelized onions, which usually pack a flavorful punch. The butternut squash ravioli also didn't offer the flavors imagines. Mostly it was the sauce that seemed to fall flat with this dish. \\n\\nThere was a sweet ending my friends, this cute little mason jar filled with layers of fresh raspberries, cream and Portuguese cookies was an amazing finish. I only wish everything had been equally as amazing.\\n\\nI still feel like I'm not done with Cafe Zinho, so hopefully the next visit will be all wines, er wins!\",\n",
       " u\"Cafe Zinho is a quaint and romantic Portuguese-American restaurant. While they may not take the progressive-dish risks of the similarly-priced contemporary cuisine options in the area, they still manage to put their own twist on classic dishes--and they do it well.\\n\\nI wish I could pinpoint a dish to recommend, but everything I tasted left me more satisfied than the previous bite. The smaller seating area allows for an intimate dinner whether you're coming as a couple or bringing the whole family. Bring your own bottle, follow your gut (or the waiter's recommendations), and sink in to Cafe Zinho. The worst part? When it's all over, you have to leave.\",\n",
       " u'Good is great and place is really cozy and romantic \\nI would also add easy parking and table by the window is nice. Service was very good \\nWe would recommend fish pasta and chicken! \\nWe will be back for sure',\n",
       " u\"I like the atmosphere, the food and the service. Just is a little small and expensive. But if don't care about the price is very good recommedation. Especially their bread that is free. I love it!!\",\n",
       " u\"Awesome BYOB Portuguese restaurant. Reservations are a must. Great service and atmosphere. Many times we have gone it has been for a selection of appetizers, salad and desert. Don't miss this restaurant if you are in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u'My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Always wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Bring your own bottle.',\n",
       " u\"This restaurant does NOT deserve the 4 Star Rating it has on Yelp...a 5 Star Rating is much more fitting.  Let's break it down:  a perfect cozy location off of Ellsworth, it's BYOB - which is always a bonus, an eclectic & intimate setting (get there early and request window seating), an attentive wait staff that is warm and welcoming...and I haven't EVEN gotten to the meal itself yet!  \\nMy husband and I took our 6 year old daughter there and we all had an amazing experience and delicious meal.  My husband's lamb burger melted in his mouth, my lamb chops were tender (medium rare) and juicy with just enough spices, my daughters spinach and cheese ravioli was so yummy she was practically licking her plate (insert appropriate level of parenting/manners ;~)\\nAll in all, my 'foody family' gave this 'gem of a Portuguese/Mediterranean restaurant' an ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP!  And, due to our phenomenal dining experience last night, will be making our next dining outing very soon to Cafe Zinho.\",\n",
       " u\"The food was innovative yet underwhelming. The ambiance was causal and quaint but not something I would recommend or choose to do again. Parking was hassle, a reservation is necessary and make sure to not show early. There is no space to wait unless you don't mind sitting outside. I typically wouldn't but as the weather begins to turn it becomes increasingly difficult to enjoy the outdoors. It seems that breakfast or brunch could be a smashing hit here but after my dinner, which I was so looking forward to, I'm not positive that I'm prepared to put this adventure at the top of my list.\",\n",
       " u\"Such a cute, quaint and artsy place tucked away on a mostly residential street in Shadyside.  I was worried about parking, but I went on a Wednesday and found parking just outside.  Before I go further, THEY ARE CASH AND PERSONAL CHECK ONLY.  I want to point that out as I am someone who usually has little cash on hand.  The ingredients were very fresh.  We had the pheasant tartine - I've never had tartine before - kind of like a pate, but more firm - almost like cold head cheese consistency.  Also my date had the puff pastry with mushrooms, which she loved.  Our entrees were very good as well - a full rack of lamb for me, and she had the bronzino - both cooked very well.  The skin on her bronzino was crispy and very tasty - and both entrees were well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  This place is also BYOB.  We will be back someday.\",\n",
       " u\"I love the Frick Mansion tour. I see why Helen Frick was so determined to preserve it. Although half of me is insanely envious of the lavish and exclusive lifestyle, I am grateful they preserved it so that I could have the privilege to walk through such Victorian art, value, and elegance. \\n\\nI am becoming a bit of a SWPA gilded age history nerd and will always be fascinated hearing their story no matter how many times because I WILL keep going back. \\n\\nMy most recent visit was in early December and it was very nice. I didn't know this but they change the theme of the tour during the holiday season. The original tour is my favorite, but was nice having known the  background with a surprise addition learning the Frick family's holiday traditions. \\n\\nIf it was not a national holiday, I would certainly be game for a Frick Mansion tour today.\",\n",
       " u\"We stopped by today to check out the current exhibit, Impressionist to Modernist: Masterworks of Early Photography.  \\nUpon entering we were greeted by a nice employee who gave us a lot of helpful information about the exhibit, and others available to us.  I was pleasantly surprised that the Art Museum portion was free. It isn't too big, we did everything in less than an hour, but still took our time to read a lot of the info and enjoy ourselves.\\nIt was my first time visiting and I found it go be a very nice way to spend an afternoon, especially on a budget.\",\n",
       " u\"I have never been here before, but I saw online they were featuring a photography exhibit: From Impressionist to Modernist. It runs until April 19th and the best part - it's free! I love photography and I'm so glad we went to look at the exhibit. The property has other buildings where you can do a tour, but we only went into the main one. As we walked in, there was a rotunda in the middle with tapestries hanging just around the walls. There was a nice lady by the door who explained what was where and how we could get to the other places to view art/house. She was incredibly informative. I definitely loved the exhibit and would recommend checking online for other features. I think their membership is really reasonable and it's a great way to get to know local things around Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"I have spent significantly more time at the Frick Art & Historical Center than I knew was possible this year.  I have written more papers and stared at the 990s for hours.  The Frick is a pretty healthy museum in the financial sense, and they have made and are planning to make a ton of new additions.\\n\\nThe museum and house tour are amazing.  They are beautifully maintained.  The museum is fairly small, four or five rooms.  The paintings are not the most famous by any stretch, but it is still cool to see some originals.  The best part?  It's free!\\n\\nThe house tour is my preference and certain days of the year it is free, though I am not sure exactly which ones.  If you are from out of town, this reminds me of a smaller version of the Isabelle Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston but on a slightly smaller scale, house-wise.  However, the grounds here probably trump the Gardner Museum.  The Model T house is currently under renovations, but you can still check out the bowling alley and gardens!  Even cooler, they use foods and herbs grown in the garden at the newly-renovated Frick Cafe, I hear.\\n\\nThere is also a very small free parking lot.  It is best to get here early if you want to utilize that, but there is some street parking as well.  Not on a major bus line.\\n\\nThe Frick is a super cool place, and for a mid-sized city, this is a true gem!\",\n",
       " u\"My family attended the Frick this Friday for a picnic while the grounds were open to the public. It was beautiful...we walked in and saw families scattered on the lawn with big picnic baskets. There were lawn toys set out for kids to play with, twinkle lights strung throughout the space and a cool mix of music playing on the speakers. Nobody greeted us, despite seeing several employees at the entrance. But we still enjoyed every bit of the evening. There were a few food trucks at the entrance, but we packed our own dinner instead. It's nice to have the option though. And another option is the on-site restaurant. \\n\\nI'm looking forward to returning with a larger group for another Friday and hopefully for one of the First Friday's when there is live music.\",\n",
       " u'What a great afternoon, we went on the fabulous tour then had brunch.  The food and service exceeded our expectations.  Great job\\nKen & Chuck',\n",
       " u\"While I don't believe you could spend an entire day at the Frick, you can easily spend a couple of hours especially if you are touring Clayton, which is about an hour tour. Admission is required for the tour, but it is free to visit the gardens and the Frick museum. Clayton epitomizes the opulence of the Gilded Age-make sure to check out the Playhouse on the way to Clayton as it is the size of a small house! Start your experience in the Grable Visitor Center. Here you can purchase admission to tour Clayton and browse their museum shop which has many interesting books about the history of Pittsburgh. \\n\\nClayton was home to the Frick family from 1883-1905 and is quite well preserved. No photographs are allowed-just an FYI. Touring is only available for the first and second floors, however, you get to see the bedrooms, the kitchen, the library, and the calling room, in addition to the servants quarters. While Frick was an extensive art collector, most of his work is displayed in New York. The family home contains many paintings of the family though. The Frick Art Museum has some of his collection and typically has a rotating exhibit as well. The car and carriage museum is an interesting step back in time as well with items ranging from old Lincolns and Rolls Royces to a winter sleigh. Photos are allowed in this area. There is also a cafe, which I hear is quite nice, however, it is also quite hard to get into and reservations are a must. I highly recommend visiting for the holidays as they attempt to redecorate the home as the Fricks did at the turn of the century. The tree is beautifully decorated this time of year and worth viewing. Also of note, there is a parking lot so be sure to take advantage of the free parking.\",\n",
       " u\"I like this place because it's family run. My last repair was on our refrigerator. Parts were ordered quickly and installed in a timely manner. Technician was friendly. As was the office staff I spoke with. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for reliable service!\",\n",
       " u\"I wanted to find a new place and tried the Wexford location since I live nearby after seeing a coupon for a haircut. OMG, I have an appointment this weekend to get my hair fixed, though it will be hard to do because I went in for a TRIM and I lost about 5 inches of hair and it is still uneven. My part which was on the left is now kinda zig zagged and my hair sticks up and out all over. I asked often about the hair being cut and I was told it was not much length but helping to get rid of the volume (I have thick hair). Yea, well 3 inches cut with my hair wet is now over 5 inches dry because of how curly my hair is, which I mentioned oh, I don't know maybe 100 times b/c she kept asking me about doing a treatment to straighten it.  No wonder they need coupons for customers. And I still tipped her because how bad I felt for her because she was telling me how poor she is because of her divorce. I should have just walked out when I was left waiting for over 30 minutes without anyone saying a word about it.\",\n",
       " u'Anna Kharitonov at Izzazu, is, in a word, amazing. Her keen understanding of what service truly means is unparalleled! The pedicure I received was excellent, but more importantly she made it a priority that I relax and enjoy the whole experience. She is professional, skilled and genuine...a breath of fresh air!',\n",
       " u\"I bought a Groupon that advertised $25 for a shampoo,  cut and style that was regularly  $70 (64% discount ).  All of that was GREAT! Craig did my hair and he was excellent and professional.  My problem is the price of the Groupon.  I didn't get to choose one of the hairdressers, which I totally understand.  However, when I was leaving. I wanted to leave a tip based on the full cost of the service,  not the Groupon price. I asked the receptionist and she said that the service I received was $30! That's nowhere near 64% off! I just feel that I was mislead.\",\n",
       " u\"I highly recommend Ziggy to anyone looking for amazing color! I went to him for the first time today, and showed him a photo of the blonde hair that I coveted. After a thorough consultation, Ziggy gave me EXACTLY what I wanted! I've never gotten the exact color that I wanted before, and I'm just thrilled with the results! Ziggy was extremely knowledgeable, kind and talented. Not only do I love my new color but, the overall experience at Izzazu was top notch. I will definitely be going back to Ziggy and Izzazu! Thank you again, Ziggy!\",\n",
       " u'I make special trips to Pittsburgh from Virginia just to have Annie H. cut, color and style my hair. She knows the latest and greatest in hair fashion and I always get stopped on the street to ask where I got my hair done (even for many months afterwards). She is very skilled at what she does and my hair looks like what you see in a magazine, no joke. You want the balayage or ombre done right? See Annie. It really is a skill to do it as it is supposed to be done. Love her!',\n",
       " u\"I arrived for my appointment at 1 o'clock on time and after sitting and waiting for half an hour was told that the stylist was running behind and it would be at least another half an hour until she could get to me. I guess her time or the current customer's time was more important than mine. I didn't stay to find out how the haircut would have gone.\",\n",
       " u'I came in on a Groupon.  They were kind to squeeze me in the same day I called and within the hour.  However when I got there, it appeared the stylist didn\\'t know yet so when the one receptionist left to tell him, the other said to her, \"He\\'s going to kill you.\"  Granted, I didn\\'t know what they were talking about... but whatever that statement meant, it didn\\'t make me feel welcomed.\\nBut when the stylist washed my hair, he literally only massaged the shampoo into half of my head, rinsed it out for 10 seconds, and finished \"washing my hair\" in the speediest time ever.\\nHe also went on to give me the fastest haircut I\\'ve ever had.  When I asked for side bangs, he basically refused and just trimmed my hair that would be side bangs.  And when I told him my that my hair is naturally shiny and I don\\'t like products in it, he still put oil in my hair without asking.  He was nice and did a nice job blow-drying my hair, but I was very disappointed with my cut.',\n",
       " u'We were wanting to order take-out one night and looked through our folder of coupons to pick a place. After being \"pizza\\'d out,\" we decided to try Miaetta\\'s due to their $20 deal (wings, hoagie, fries and a soda). \\n\\nThe food was good. Nothing spectacular. The wings were sort of dainty, though I feel they compensated by giving us more than a dozen. The garlic parm sauce was also very light. They could have been a bit more generous. We ordered the Miaetta hoagie which was pretty much like a club. Once again, good but nothing to write home about. I could have made the same sandwich myself. Fries were standard. One thing to add - I found it strange that they only had four sodas to choose from: Pepsi, Mt. Dew, a generic juice and something else. \\n\\nConsidering this place is extremely close to us, I would stop back to try other things on the menu. According to the other reviews on Yelp, their gourmet Italian food is what they\\'re known for. Now we know what to order next time. My boyfriend said the scene on the inside was very old fashioned and homey, so I\\'d love to check them out again but perhaps dining in rather than take-out. I love nothing more than a good \\'ole mom and pops kitchen!',\n",

       " u'The soft serve here is very tasty. They do the chocolate chip cookie sundaes really well. They also pack in the flavor in the birthday cake soft serve. It is always very busy despite a run down makeshift parking area, not much curb appeal, and being cash only.',\n",
       " u\"Everyone waits for Page's to open in the Spring and is sad when it closes for the winter. It's a small establishment with no seating, but there is always a line at the order windows. Page's is a Pittsburgh landmark. My family has been going for 20 years but it's been around for many many years. \\nPage's serves hamburgers, icecream cones, sundaes, shakes, pretty much anything you can do with ice cream . . . and it's all good. One of my favorite's is a sundae made with a Nancy B's cookie. (Please tell me that you know what a Nancy B cookie is!) but sometimes I order just a simple twist. \\nPeople hang out in the parking lot and eat there ice cream.

There are soooooo many options. The menu itself is huge, then all around the windows they advertise even more options!! I couldn't get a good look at the menu because the line was long & heads were in the way. The next thing i know, it was my turn and i still couldn't decide. \\n\\nI asked if they had a brownie sundae and ordered that. Bobby said he was only thirsty and ordered a banana shake. \\n\\nI enjoyed my sundae but next time I will try something different that's on their menu. They had so many options for an arctic swirl so I'm looking forward to trying one of those next. Also, the banana split i noticed someone having was gigantic.

Our usual order consists of the basics: swirled soft serve (cup or cone) dipped in crunches or jimmies.\\n\\nNot only do they have soft serve but also a wide variety of insane sundae creations and other novelties.

       " u\"I don't love ice cream, I'm more of a salty snack girl, but this place is a dream come true. They just came out with their yearly blueberry soft serve magic. The signs on E Carson leading up to Page's tease me to stop in daily on my work commute but I couldn't pass up the blueberry and it did not disappoint! There is something about the friendly neighborhood ice cream joint that opens and closes with the seasons. Page's is a must try at least once a year, even if you don't love ice cream!\",\n",

Well I ordered butter pecan 'ice cream' and what do they bring me? Vanilla! Wow are their servers just lazy or dumb?\",\n",
       " u\"Over-hyped. I thought that Page's tasted like an average soft-serve ice cream shop. I was also surprised about the lack of flavors that they offered, there was no cookies and cream or sorbets.\\n\\nI ordered a small Chocolate Chip ice cream with rainbow sprinkles and my boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Shortcake sundae. My Chocolate Chip ice cream tasted identical to Breyer's boxed ice cream from the grocery store. I may have ordered the wrong item but because it is soft-serve ice cream they don't offer samples. My boyfriend had the Strawberry Shortcake sundae which had 3 pieces of cake on the bottom, 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, strawberry syrup, strawberries (not fresh), almonds and whipped cream. It was huge and they didn't allow him to swap flavors or make any adjustments.\\n\\nMaybe my expectations of Page's were too high, but when I had heard about this ice cream shop whose line wrapped down the street I knew I had to check this place out. When I went on a Friday night there was no line and the ice cream was sub-par.\",\n",
       " u'This place isn\\'t very good. I ordered a sundae and asked for a flavored ice cream but was told they could only do chocolate or vanilla because of \"how they mix it\".  It\\'s a sundae so no mixing is involved so I don\\'t understand that. Then when I got it, it was missing half the toppings that were listed in the description. Definitely not as good as people claim. Won\\'t be going back.',\n",
       " u\"Dude... the Cookie sundae\\n\\nHidden between the Waterfront and Southside in a pretty random area, it's pretty easy to miss this place. Surrounded by hills and located under a bridge. The only other thing nearby is a car place. But this is Pittsburgh, it seems to me that some of the best things in the city are hidden.\\n\\nIce cream is soft serve and is your pretty standard good ice cream: creamy, soft, cold, with authentic flavors. It's delicious. But honestly, good ice cream can be found in many places in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nSo what makes this place stand out from all the other ice cream places in Pittsburgh is the fact that they have delicious sundaes. My favorite is the cookie sundae, which has fresh-out-of-the-oven-melt-in-your-mouth cookies on top of a mountain of ice cream and hot fudge. They use Nancy B's bakery cookies. Yum.\\n\\nThe menu is HUGE. So no, I haven't tried everything. Also, I've found love in the cookie sundae, so I may just stick to that.\\n\\nPlace is cash-only.\",\n",

       " u\"Very good Italian. The portions are very large, so do not be tempted by the bread early. My fianc\\xe9 and I shared two appetizers and an entree. The entree also gives a huge bowl of salad and penne alla vodka. This was so much food, we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. I would absolutely recommend this place, but would suggest pacing yourself.\",\n",
       " u\"Let me start out by saying that we rarely look to dining out for Italian food. We have found that to find quality Italian worthy of spending $$ outside of our own home has been difficult to find in the Burg. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Italian restaurants out there, but none we would seek out for a special occasion, so to speak. We have always found the New York/New Jersey establishments more to our liking....until now.\\n\\nAlla Famiglia is nestled in a not so nice of a neighborhood in the Burg called Allentown. Although we were never worried, but I could see how some may feel it is out of place in it's location. There is valet parking, so need to worry about your car while dining. Now once you are inside, you will soon forget where you are.\\n\\nThe inside is very small and there are 3 floors where you may be seated for your meal. On this occassion, we were seated on the third floor. Way up, climbing 3 flights of stairs can work up an appetite. Once on the 3rd level however, you can enjoy some of the religious artwork and beautiful stainglass featured throughout the dining area. There were 5 tables of various sizes and the bonus was the private restroom located nearby, so you did not have to manage the steps again until you were finished with your meal. \\n\\nI would also like to mention that we were dining early and although the room was rather private at first, it became QUITE loud as the evening went on and other patrons were being seated. I also think the free flowing wine helped the noise levels as the night progressed. Needless to say, we had difficulty hearing one another towards the end of the meal.\\n\\nThere were 5 in our party and our server was very attentive throughout the night to make sure any requests or special customizations were welcomed and met. We started our meal with the complimentary bread, dipping oils, goat cheese spread and cheese medley brought to the table. We all agreed to share the famous 12 oz stuffed meatball which was enjoyed by everyone at the table. In fact, everyone was asking for more of the wonderful sauce to accompany thier bread.\\n\\nSeveral items are served family style and come with any of the entrees that are ordered. We were then delivered and very tasty salad tossed with a light vinegarette which included olives, nuts and cranberries. Gorgonzola was brought on the side if desired. Then the pasta with vodka sauce made it's arrival. Several mentioned that they would have just ordered this if they knew how delicious it was. And this was just the beginning....\\n\\nOn came the entrees, several veal dishes were ordered, as it is their signature item on the menu. Although there were also many specials offered that night, everyone seemed to gear towards the classics. I ordered the veal marsala, which was delish! It was certainly one of the best I have had. One member of our dining party ordered the special pork chop offered that was huge! Another entree ordered was the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and gorgonzola cream sauce. It literally melted in your mouth! I decided this would definitely be ordered on my next visit. All the food was cooked perfectly to order and scrumptious!\\n\\nWe were all pretty full but decided to share the Burnt almond tiramisu stuffed with raspberry for dessert. It was divine! I swear I heard the angels in the nearby painting sing as we devoured it!\\n\\nAs others had mentioned, it is a bit pricey, but for special occassions it is a must do. I felt it was quite worth every penny of our bill which was $306 for the party of 5. (We did BYOB) We have dined at much more expensive establishments and left unimpressed, which was not the case at all here.\\n\\nThe only negative was the long walk down the steps through the many other diners after too much wine. It can be challenging! So, watch your step! But do make a visit, you won't be disappointed!\",\n",
       " u\"Outstanding meal.  Will absolutely go back.  \\n\\nRestaurant is small with very busy/tight space vibe.  Try antipasto appetizer if available when you go.  Also, the meatball appetizer is kind of a signature item to this establishment, so absolutely try as well.  All entrees comes with salad and pasta, so come ready for a big meal that will be worth every calorie, every bite.   We had veal and duck entrees and they really were quite deliciously special.  Lots of leftovers came home with us.  \\n\\nArea not so shady, so don't let this discourage you.  They have Valet as well, which makes parking easy.\",\n",
       " u\"This spot is the definition of a hidden gem. I lived in Pittsburgh for 5 years and still had not been here or heard of it despite my extreme obsession with Italian food. It was thanks to Yelp we discovered it and what a discovery!!!!\\n\\nIts been a couple months since I ate here so my memory of each course is a little foggy but, suffice it to say, that every single time I now crave Italian food, this restaurant is what comes to mind. I now live in Philly otherwise I would probably end up here every other week (which would hit hard on the wallet since its delicious but pricey).\\n\\nIt's a small place with a very romantic/intimate vibe and an authentic feel. The portions were generous and extremely tasted even better re-heated the next day (a rare thing). \\n\\nThe one thing I would advise is do not gorge on the bread! This will be very difficult to do as it is delicious, along with the oil it is served with but you will regret it because there will be a lot of food coming afterwards. The waiter warned us but we couldn't resist and barely had room for the delicious courses that followed.\\n\\nThis might be one of my all time favorite restaurants and I plan to come here again (most likely for an occasion that warrants the cost).\",\n",
       " u\"Their prices are exorbitant but so worth it. I've only had Italian this good in NY, LA, and Italy. No wonder there are pictures of celebrities all over the walls. What a hidden gem. $260 for two? Money well spent.\",\n",
       " u'Let me say this place is awesome! Heard about it through word of mouth from a friend, and decided to get reservations... And it was such a good dining experience! \\nGrade A+ Italian. \\n\\nGot the meatball appetizer and it was delicious. My girlfriend got the seafood Diablo, my god! It was spicy and delicious... I absolutely loved. I ordered the veal chop! My god it tasted tender buttery and made my tastebuds flourish. The pasta sauce was made perfectly and the salad was tangy and contained a number of mind blasting flavors as well! \\n\\nService was very good and friendly. Our server was named Daniel. He did a fantastic job.\\n\\nGreat place for an anniversary, birthday, or any really quality meal.\\n\\nLove it, will return.',\n",
       " u'Everything about Alla Famiglia was outstanding. They start you off with freshly baked bread accompanied with olive oil with basil and pepper, a chickpea, pepper flakes and cheese mix, and a goat cheese and walnut spread. The next course is a salad with red wine vinaigrette with olives, roasted red peppers and raisins. They bring out a pasta with vodka sauce about 5 minutes before the entrees, sort of like a side to the meal. My boyfriend got the Veal Chop Milanese which was excellent, soft with a crispy crust. I got the Seafood Diavolo, it was pure seafood heaven for me. It had a nice spicy kick to it, without being overbearing. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. I will say that it is not a cheap restaurant (entrees started at $50), so definitely a special occasion place, but totally worth it!',\n",
       " u\"Pretty good food, I felt so miserably full afterwards. I think the things that come with the meal are far better than the meal itself. I really enjoyed the warm bread and the salad with candied walnuts. Family style pasta was included as well, if I go back again I'd only want those things.\",\n",
       " u'This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is only outdone by the quality of the food.  Order the veal chop.  Phenomenal experience and the only place I recommend to every person that visits Pittsburgh!',\n",
       " u\"Without question the best Italian Food I have devour! Everything they make is simply delicious! I can't really write a 3 paragraph essay when there is one word.... Perfect - you may never own a Bentley! But you can eat as if you own one!\",\n",
       " u\"Old school Italian. Enough said. This place sets the standard for great Italian food.\\nThe meatballs are a muct have and the pastas are incredible.\\nI had a veal chop with long hots. It just doesn't get any better.\\nAnd don't miss the tiramisu. As good as it gets.\",\n",
       " u'My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always delicious and I always order a different entree. The accompaniments to the meal are perfect. Every. Single. Time. Love this place!',\n",
       " u\"This place is wildly, unabashedly, insanely- two things. \\n\\n1) Honest. It is honest in its presentation and commitment to the abbreviated menu that it produces. \\n\\n2) Outstanding. The Chef and his team execute at a very very high level. \\n\\nProtip: I came in on a very slow moment. Early early dinner with some work people. We had the pleasure of talking to the Chef- as we were seated at the table just by the door, in close proximity to the kitchen (you'll get it when you get there). We liked the guy so much we handed the menus back to the server and told him to just bring us whatever the chef suggested. \\n\\nThe whole meal was amazing. But I will say this without any qualification. The next sentence is not at all taken lightly. \\n\\nThe smoked cheese app with truffle oil, arugula, and lemon was the best first bite of food I have ever had in my life, a life that has had a considerable amount of top contenders for bites. \\n\\nLet that sink in. Go eat here.\",\n",
       " u\"Rating the overall experience we had here.\\n\\nFirst off this is family style multi-course meal;  every main dish comes with a salad and pasta dish to share.  The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.\\n\\nWe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.\\n\\nThe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!\\n\\nWhen you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  \\n\\nSo now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.\\n\\nIt was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here. \\n\\nWe really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.\",\n",
       " u\"I've reviewed and I'll review again... Best Italian in Pittsburgh by far!\\n\\nYou have to experience at least once.\",\n",
       " u'One of the best meals that I have had in PIttsburgh.  We had the mussels in a slightly spicy red sauce, and their meatball.  For both of these appetizers, the sauce was amazing - the best that I have had.  So good that I could have happily made a meal out of the sauce and their bread, which was hot and fresh.  For our entres, we had the lamb chops and the veal chops, cooked Milanese style.  Both dishes were cooked perfectly - the Milanese was pan fried and a bit delicately flavored, but wonderful.  The service was very good, and all the staff were working very hard and quick, but were available to answer questions and assist us when needed.  I would recommend making reservations well in advance and trying to get one of the tables upstairs - a more quiet and intimate setting, also slightly more comfortable temperature wise for me.  The kitchen is downstairs, and is open to the dining room, so I think we got some of the heat. I will definitely go back there someday.',\n",
       " u'From the appetizer to the meal itself everything was great. Our server Bob was informative and detailed in explaining the menu a great addition to this establishments.',\n",
       " u\"There was a wonderful staff that I would go for to my surprise the last time I went I was disappointed the wonderful staff he had was gone I was not happy with my last experience and it was not as homey and family oriented as it was before food wasn't that great either! Not happy about the new staff. Also over heard the owner using racial slurs and provocative terms that just made my stomach turn for these reasons I will not be returning!\",\n",
       " u'Excellent food!!!!! Very expensive but you do get very high quality food and plenty if it. The portions are huge. It kind of seems out of place in its location but whatever',\n",
       " u'I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don\\'t notice.\\n\\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn\\'t hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\\n\\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else\\'s entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\\n\\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.',\n",
       " u\"We visited for our anniversary and let me start off by saying that dinner here is an event. Be prepared to come and stay for hours and enjoy your food, company, and wine. A couple near us was in a hurry and I feel like they missed out on half the fun of dinner. But to each their own.\\nI love a good coursed meal, absolutely love it. We started with the hand rolled mozzarella, which was fantastic. As was the white bean spread. The salad was fresh and crisp. My absolute favorite part of the meal though was the pasta with vodka sauce. I could write songs about this pasta dish. I'm telling you now the next time we return I will simply eat this pasta until I'm so full I could die a fat and happy death. \\nFor our entrees Chris had the veal chop (holy mother this thing had to weigh 5 pounds! And it was PERFECTLY cooked). And I very much enjoyed the mahi. We did not even remotely save room for dessert. The best part ofall of this was that we had enough food to have a complete meal the next day for three people. The portions are THAT generous. But oh that pasta. My mouth waters just thinking about it!\",\n",
       " u\"I enjoyed my meal at Alla Famiglia. The service is great and the atmosphere is OK (a little oddly decorated for such a high-end eatery). However, I don't know that the food was so good that it justified the high price point. This place is expensive and reserved for special occasions, which I knew coming in, but I wasn't really that blown away by my meal. You do get A LOT of food, but walking away with $300+ bill for a group of 4 just seems over the top when you consider the fact you're eating mostly pasta.\",\n",
       " u'Definitely an experience.   Make sure you save room for many courses    High class.  Perfect for a anniversary dinner or date night.   Salads where amazing fresh and crisp.  Pasta coarse was delicious. Waiters were attentive but not overwhelming.  Bar service was friendly and gin martini was strong but delicious.   Fabulous restaurant',\n",
       " u'This is hands down the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The food has been consistently perfect.  The service is amazing.  The drinks are big.  They are planning an expansion to increase table space.  Jonathan knows the business and is the best in town.  The veal chop is the signature dish with several preparations.  Every dinner is complimented with salad and vodka pasta that is a meal in and of itself.  The meatball appetizer cannot be skipped.  It is stuffed with mozzarella and topped with Parmesan cheese.  Jonathan Also has the restaurant in Peters Twp which is a smaller version of Alla Famiglia but still very good!',\n",
       " u\"This place is amazing! From start to finish our experience was fantastic.  Our server was friendly and knowledgable.  I really liked the coziness of the layout as a renovated house.  The kitchen is on the first floor when you walk in.  They bring out a warm loaf of bread and several accompaniments-- oil-- cheese-- chick peas and olives... Deeeelish! There is no rush, think of it as a dining experience-- so don't go if you are in a hurry--- you want to enjoy every part. Also-- go hungry.  Every review said to get the meatball app so I thought I had to try it too!!! I will say-- get the meatball app! It is delicious. After your appetizer arrives, they will bring out salad family style and it is not your average salad.  There are walnuts and olives on a bed of mixed greens. It was wonderful.  Then comes the pasta with vodka sauce (everyone gets some!!!) which was incredible. Save most of it for your lunch tomorrow because your entree will be fantastic!!! I had the swordfish which was covered in lump crab meat. Sooooo good!!!\\n\\nI was too full for dessert.  I will definitely be back. It is a great place for a celebration or when you want a meal to savor. The owner walked around and talked to tables and even brought out our meals.  Our dinner for two was around $150 and we had cocktails. This place is worth the splurge.\",\n",
       " u'OK,\\n\\nProbably one of the nicer meals I have had out in a long time.  Food was over the top Excellent.\\nSpendy no doubt but if you have the chance, this is a must. Seating is a little tight and service to honest could have been better attention to detail. But the food, jeeez, I mean really really well done.  The The Veal Chop Milanese is off the hook and the portions are giant. The pasta is superb.  The cheesecake is absolutely fantastic and I may inquire on the recipe for that one. If you have a chance this is a must do.',\n",
       " u'What a fantastic meal.   Apps were delicious but too much food with entrees!   Staff was very helpful to box leftovers.   Great wine list.   We look forward to returning soon.   \\n\\nThe meatballs were great.   The fresh mozzarella was fantastic.    Oh and the veal!   Every entree was a winner!  Even the house salad was great.',\n",
       " u\"We were in from out of town and someone recommended we go here. We did not know we would need reservations, but when we walked in, the owner John actually seated us right away at the bar and invited us to eat there even without the reservation, and believe me they were packed. He was very accommodating. The bartender Josh was amazing and just as good with the food menu as he was with the drink menu. Staff was polite, selection was perfect, not overwhelmingly big or too limited. Most importantly of course, the food was AMAZING. I've eaten in many very notable restaurants around the country, and this one is right up there with the best of them. 5 stars across the board. Nothing too complain about whatsoever!\",\n",
       " u'5 stars: 3rd time we have been and the food gets better every time! \\nThe meatball appetizer is a must starter. Salad and pasta delicious not to mention the bread and accompaniment.  Veal chop is fantastic. Desert out of this world good. \\nAtmosphere in the front is right next to the kitchen... Delicious! \\nChef Jonathan and alla familia has been a fixture long before the Pittsburgh food scene boom! \\nWe will make a point to go back more and more often.',\n",
       " u\"We had the mushrooms, meatball appetizer, pasta, salad, veal piccata and spaghetti with clam sauce. A nice pasta dish with roasted veggies and marinara was made as a special order. But I was not wowed by this restaurant. Large portions are not enough to impress me. The tastes were good, but for the prices, I'd expect better. If you're a big meat eater, or love to eat huge amounts of pasta, ok, this is great. But the sauces were just ok, nothing spectacular. Spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu. Would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking? I'm sure the deserts are good but we didn't have any - but the sizes of the appetizers and entrees is just over the top, but not worth the premium prices to me.\",\n",
       " u\"This is my favorite place to eat!  The greens and beans, the meatball, and the hot cheese for appetizers are excellent.  I love the pasta with a dash of the oil they give you. The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent alternative to red sauce.   I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad meal.  The Veal Chop is by far my favorite.  Huge portions which usually come home!! ;)\\nThe atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not the best! Lol but the police station is a cross the street. So it's all good!   \\nThis is the perfect place for a great meal with great service for any function or just date night!\",\n",
       " u\"This place is so special and we are so lucky to have it in Pittsburgh. Our table wasn't ready when we got there.  So they took us upstairs to the bar. We had not  been here in years so seeing the bar upstairs was brand-new to us. The cocktails were fantastic! While we were up there, we met the owner, and he made some recommendations to us. You have to get a meatball appetizer to split with the table.  Four of us split one and it was plenty. They had littleneck clams on special and they were done absolutely perfectly.  Our husbands got Veal Parmesan and loved it. We also had beans and greens appetizer it was delicious.  Next time, I would probably get it without the sausage. It was delicious but I'm not much of a sausage person.There were so many other things that we could've ordered it was hard to decide. You really feel like you are at someone's house when you're eating there. I would only want to sit in the front room to see the kitchen.  We still were able to bring our own wine there like so many years ago. We will be back again very soon. If you have never been here... you definitely need to go. And  if you haven't been in a while you need to get back there.\",\n",
       " u'This is the worst Chinese food I have had in a long time. The Crab Rangoon was clunky and too thick. There was no crab on the inside-it was all cream cheese. The egg roll I had was dripping grease and was filled with cabbage and nothing else. There were no other veggies or anything. The Sesame Chicken was mushy by the time I got home and I live 5 minutes away. It was all mushy breading and very little chicken. I ate 3 bites and threw it away. This meal was an EPIC FAIL.',\n",

So i know its not fresh. Then i go to pay and she says 9.58. Which is annoying. But after that long rant the food wasnt on the fresher side, it looked very dry, BUT it was has a really good flavor! it isnt spicy at all if thats what youre looking for and idk if they dont do sizes  but if this is a small good Lord idk what the large would look like.

       " u\"One of the happiest moments of my life began with me picking up the phone and calling the number for DiCarlo's.

It was love at first bite. I went there frequently and tried to recruit as many allies as I could. The insanely crunchy crust, the zippy tomato sauce, the CHEESE! The first slice of the day with completely cold, unmelted cheese was always just as good as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. But tragedy struck and Cranberry failed hard again at supporting good pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.\\n\\nBut one day, I noticed something exhilarating. Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, excited, bashful, sleepy, doc, but most of all relieved. That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.\\n\\nThat very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare treat...) to rekindle my love affair. I gotta say, friends, this was one of the best first bites I have ever had. Exactly as I remember it. Four slices of pepperoni pizza and an Orange Crush. This is living. And I gotta say, it feels great.\\n\\nGod bless you, DiCarlo's.\",\n",

I'm used to going to the buzzing place in Elm Grove, but we were in Pittsburgh so I decided to stop and try this DiCarlo's out. I was not disappointed! Although it is in a dingy area and it doesn't have as many customers as Elm Grove does, the pizza is still the same. I actually think the crust is a little crunchier here and I LOVED that! This was a perfect lunch stop to fill my stomach up with some unforgettable pizza!\",\n",

Be forewarned that this is a greasy, greasy pie and the crust is very thin. I know that isn't for everyone but for me it is exactly what I want in a pizza. We ordered a large Mushroom and it was perfect. Lots of mushrooms and totally satisfying\\n\\nI have to say that because they have just reopened, all of the local people who loved this food have been coming back so the wait was quite long. I think it is worth it though. And since this is their first weekend being reopened, I am sure they will work out the kinks soon.\\n\\nIn terms of the restaurant itself, they walls have lost a little character. There used to be a collage of black and white photos of celebrities covering the walls. Now everything is covered in this stone wallpaper, some of which is upside down. But, I do have to say that everything feels much cleaner than it was back in the day, mostly due to new boothes, and much brighter lighting. \\n\\nWhat can I say, I love this place and I hope that they continue to get the kind of business they seem to be getting now.\",\n",
       " u'Stopped in tonight and got a large Pizza with Peppeoni and Sausage. I called ahead would definitely recommend calling your order in the place was very busy but worth the wait. The pizza is thin crust and was delicious. Great new pizza place.',\n",
       " u\"Very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend at all. Got a large pizza. The quality was horrible. The sauce was not a good flavor at all. I had to wait 2 hours just for a pick up for this crap. Their pizza box was more like a diaper. The Pizza bagels were soggy yet burned. The employees looked like a bunch of drug addicts hanging out. And the Prices too high. Biggest waste of money!!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm glad they are back open! We missed you guys! This is greasy cheesy pizza exactly what I like. This is CASH only but there is an ATM directly across the street.\",\n",
       " u\"They're open again!\\n\\nTheir pizza bagels are my absolute favorite, and they bring back memories. I used to love grabbing a pizza bagel and an Italian ice after school or after softball games. I'd sit in the booths and stare at the walls that had millions of pictures on them. I even snuck a school picture of myself behind the plexiglass. Then I'd grab a gum ball from the big machine by the front door.\\n\\nThey just recently reopened, and I'm so happy to be able to taste my childhood again. Their bagels are just like how I remember.\",\n",
       " u'Great neighborhood bar.\\nGreat beer selection. Burgers and falafel .\\nFree peanuts and popcorn.\\nZ is the best .',\n",
       " u\"I hesitate to leave this review simply because I'm afraid my favorite local spot will get too popular! The Park House is awesome. The food is simple and tasty and the beer selection is great. Not sure what you want? Jeremy or one of the other super friendly and knowledgeable bartenders will give you a taste and help you decide. Not hungry enough for dinner but want some snacks with your beer? Peanuts and popcorn are on the house. Trivia on Tuesdays and Bluegrass on Wednesdays are both a great time. Finally, I cannot say enough about the service here. Z and his staff are friendly and attentive. They go out of their way to make you feel at home and get your served quickly. Definitely stop by and see for yourself!\",\n",
       " u\"More of a 3.5, but definitely not a 4 in my opinion. After living in Pittsburgh for 10 years, 4+ of which have been spent on the North Side, I finally stopped in after reading reviews and passing by this bar a hundred times.\\n\\nI arrived on a Friday night a few minutes after they opened. Aside from the bartender and another guy who I came to realize was the owner, I was the only person there. Shortly thereafter the place started filling up with a mostly younger crowd.\\n\\nI ordered a beer and enjoyed the free peanuts while I waited for my boyfriend to arrive. It took a couple minutes for me to become comfortable throwing the shells on the ground, but then it was a lot of fun to do.\\n\\nWhen the bf arrived, we ordered some food. The menu is pretty small, but we found something that we would each enjoy. He had a burger with sweet potato fries and their gyro, I ordered the hummus. \\n\\nBe prepared for a wait. It wasn't until after I ordered that I saw a mention on the bottom of the menu asking for patience as the food is prepared. Yah, we waited about 30 minutes as the only person preparing all the food is the owner. By the way, the food prep area is close to the bar. I figured this out after I kept hearing a microwave go off every minute. \\n\\nThe hummus was served with two, warm pitas (not sliced). I didn't dislike the taste, but didn't love the hummus. I'll instead stick with hummus from Alladin's . The boyfriend noted that he enjoyed the burger and gyro, although the gyro didn't look like a traditional gyro one would usually order. I tried his sweet potato fries and again wasn't thrilled.\\n\\nWe'll likely give them another try sometime soon, but might stick to eating somewhere else first or only grabbing an appetizer here.\\n\\nAmbiance - 4\\nService - 3\\nFood - 3\",\n",
       " u\"I love you Park House. You're always so good to me. You treat me right. Your spirits warm my soul. Your beers fill my belly. I've taken so much and all I can give back to you is this shitty review. \\xc0 tout \\xe0 l'heure.\",\n",
       " u\"Stopped in to The Park House on a recent Tuesday evening. The place was pretty full with people participating in their weekly Trivia night. Although it looked like a lot of fun, we didn't take part.\\n\\nMy boyfriend was hungry and thirsty. I was just thirsty\\n\\nAlthough it was only around 9 in the evening, the majority of people were drinking - not eating. As I mentioned in my first review of this restaurant, the menu is pretty small. Also, all of the food is pretty much prepared by the owner at one end of the bar. He uses microwaves to heat up just about everything. The food isn't bad, it's just not great and there's absolutely nothing special about it. So, do yourself a favor and come here for beer.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the gyro and hummus platter. I noticed that the tzatziki sauce had been sitting out uncovered and underneath a hot light for a significant amount of time before finally being covered by the owner. I found this to be a bit gross, especially since there is dairy in the sauce. By the way, we learned that the sauce is not homemade, but is doctored up by the owner.\\n\\nThe hummus platter came with two warm (microwaved) pitas. The owner noted that he makes his own hummus. It was pretty tasty, but definitely wasn't a plentiful portion.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like about this experience at The Park House was that the owner was eating food behind the counter (with gloves) and seemed to be preoccupied with a woman that was sitting near us. I wanted to say something to him about eating with his gloves on, but I felt extremely awkward.\\n\\nWe'll continue to come here, but in the future we will pass on the food.\",\n",
       " u\"Gyros are delicious! Called for a pick up order and it was ready in 10 minutes. They also have a nice beer selection. Bluegrass night on Wednesdays gets pretty crowded, so you'll probably want to get there early.\",\n",
       " u'Came here for the second time since last winter... and the feel was completely different. It is not in the best part of town firstly- there are people in front of it begging for money, some people ask you for \"squares\" which I found out are cigarettes- point being I know  cannot dock the restaurant for that- BUT management can take measures to keep the people from being right in front of their door. \\n\\nCame here on a Tuesday night after a kickball game with my team- I talked this place up because the last time I was here the food, drink, and atmosphere was awesome. This time... not so much. \\n\\nThe bar is understaffed, those who are seated wait like 7-10 minutes to get their drinks; as a bar that serves food- the bartender came to our table like one time every 15-20 minutes; because they have 2 people working here-where it needed to be at least 3-4. \\n\\nAnyway, it was trivia night when we came here. The trivia, complementary popcorn, and peanuts definitely were an up side that made waiting for drinks and food somewhat better. Their selection of drinks here is superb which is also a big plus. \\n\\nI ordered 2 orders of falafel without bread; after a long period of time (45 mins) I went to the bartender and asked her about my falafel orderS she only put in an order for one and gave it to somebody else... \\n\\nAll I can say was I was disappointed. But I have been here when there was a band, good service, and really fun atmosphere- I hope its better next time.',\n",
       " u\"This place is a dump. Being new to Pittsburgh we bought a bunch of Groupons to try new places in town. We decided to check out the Park House for a bite to eat and a few drinks. What a joke. Even though the Groupon included menu items, they don't have a kitchen. They have a microwave on the bar and all of their food choices are microwave. Gross, and it's a dirty, sketchy bar on the corner of East Ohio and Cedar. Never again ... They can keep the other Groupon. Maybe they can use the money to buy some real food.\",\n",
       " u\"Went to see a friend's band play and grab a bite to eat. I haven't been here in a while and don't remember the menu having a Mediterranean flair. I ordered the Savvy Serbian which was perfectly grilled with swiss cheese and a roasted red pepper spread on a challah roll. (I think that's what the roll was called.) Either way, it was damn delicious. The falafel was also really good. It tasted really fresh and grainy-in a good way.  Could have used a wee bit more cumin, but it was still really good. The crowd had a good vibe, and the staff were friendly. A true Pittsburgh mainstay.\",\n",
       " u\"Awesome place! I go on Wednesdays for bluegrass night and a few beers. They have a great selection on beer and the decor is so cool and interesting. It's a great slice of Pittsburgh history. The environment is friendly, the people are friendly, the staff is friendly, the band is friendly. They have a popcorn machine and a peanut bin for free munchies. Just go!\\n\\nPeanut allergic people: note the mention of a giant bin of peanuts.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is pretty terrible, but it is the only place to get gas in the area. It's always overcrowded and the receipts never print.\",\n",
       " u'authentic german cuisine. Love the schnitzels and the red cabbage',\n",
       " u\"A tour of German restaurants in Pittsburgh is surprisingly brief, and it definitely has to contain a stop at Max's. I prefer this place to Penn Brewery. The food seems a little more authentic and I haven't had a bad meal here yet. LOVE the potato pancakes. Every schnitzel I've tried has been great too.\",\n",
       " u\"Max's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.\\n\\nFinal note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been going to Max's since I was a kid in 1973..was the best food then and now. Introduced my wife to it and she's hard to please. She loved it so much that we had our wedding reception there in the Ratskeller. Can't recommend it enough\",\n",
       " u\"I was.very disappointed in the food. If you want bland tasteless food, then stop here. They need to get out of the 70's with the decor.\\n\\nI ordered the corned beef and cabbage sandwich, it was edible but not enjoyable. Don't waste your money here there are much better choices\",\n",
       " u\"Great German food don't know what all the other poster's are talking about. Wife,daughter, and I were all pleased with the food...the beer sampler was great also.. I didn't get sick, my food came out hotter than hell I had to let it sit to cool, and the wait staff was excellent. We went on a Friday night and it was packed.. I expected worse for how crowded it was... We will be returning..\",\n",
       " u\"Honestly, the coolest pub in North Side and arguably one of the best in Pittsburgh. Max's offers some awesome German Pub grub with a delightful atmosphere whether you'd like to sit down and dine or sit-in at the bar and enjoy the ballgame.\",\n",
       " u'The bartender was fantastic and the food was even better! I got the sausage sampler and it was delicious. The sauer kraut and mustard were great as well.',\n",
       " u\"One of my favorite north side haunts. Great to take visitors who need to understand what it means to be German in Pittsburgh. \\n\\nGet the soft pretzels. Get anything that comes with a potato pancake. Get the kielbasa. Get it all. You can't go wrong. \\n\\nOh, and the spaetzle. The spaetzle.......\",\n",
       " u\"Really cool and old school inside. The food is legit! The potato pancakes are good, the sausage and cheese app is simple and awesome! The corned beef and cabbage sandwich was great and definitely one of my favorites. We also did the sampler platter, consisting of wiener schnitzel, Jagerschnitzel, and sauerbraten. Everything overall is really good and pretty authentic. Our server was on her shit too! Great pre bus and we never had an empty glass. We came here because a friend came just yesterday for the first time and raved about it, I'm glad we came, and we will definitely be back!\",\n",
       " u\"BEWARE OF THE KETCHUP.  My family has always loved Max's; we've been going there since I was a child, and my sister even had her rehearsal dinner there.  So imagine my dismay when we tried brunch there today, and they gave me a botulism-filled bottle of ketchup that exploded black crud all over my shirt.  Then, they didn't even do anything to make it up to me.  The brunch was also very sub-standard; everything was cold.  Not even the potato pancakes tasted good.  I've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the Holiday Inn.  But perhaps part of the meal was also tainted by the fact that I couldn't get the thought of their negligence for food contamination out of my head.  Who knows how long that sour cream had been sitting out!  I'm really disappointed; I had really enjoyed going to Max's up to this point.  Don't think we'll be back!\",\n",
       " u\"All the reviews are right on about this place! Authentic German food and brews, great bar in front if your just drinking. Only complaint was there was a wire bristle thing sticking out of our pork loin. Not sure how it got there and we didn't say anything. Large selection of brews here.\",\n",
       " u\"When you go to Max's you sort of feel like you're stepping into Cheers in the 1980's, in a good way! Friendly staff who remember you and provide friendly, efficient service. Great location for happy hour or casual business meetings. Must try the stuffed pretzels! Haven't had any of the dinner entrees, but all of the appetizers are delicious.\",\n",
       " u\"I stopped by Max's with some friends during the Deutschtown Music Festival. The place was packed, but we were quickly greeted and did not have to wait long for a table to open up. A quick look at the menu let us know that prices were very fair.\\n\\nWe tried the sausage and cheese sampler appetizer and it was simplicity at it's finest - fresh, delicious sausage, rich cheeses, and an excellent mustard for dipping. I was really impressed with how such a simple appetizer could convey the quality of their food so well. Delicious!\\n\\nThe entrees were equally as tasty. I tried a turkey reuben which came on a potato pancake. Obviously, this particular entree was not the most traditional German faire, but, once you took a bite, there was no going back. A variety of sides were available; I tried the spaetzle - also very simple, but delicious.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great place - cozy vibe, excellent German food (both traditional and more adventurous), and quick, friendly service. My only regret is not having room to try their tempting desserts. We don't get to the Deutschtown neighborhood often, but we will have to make it a point to go back for Max's Allegheny Tavern.\",\n",
       " u'A great place to go for German food! Normally I absolutely love everything about the food here. My favorite item is the potato pancake turkey reuben sandwich, which is prepared with turkey and cole slaw. However, during this visit, the potato pancakes were overcooked and the accompanying German potato salad was served at room temperature. The fish sandwich was large, hot, and delicious. It was accompanied by sweet & sour red cabbage, which tasted great. The server was quite pleasant and efficient, which is normally the case. I will definitely return to this restaurant, because the atmosphere is welcoming and the food is very good.',\n",
       " u\"Great German food. Wonderful location in an up and coming neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Great attention to detail and to capturing the old world flavor of the menu, but no pretense - a friendly, family oriented and not overly expensive establishment. Highly recommended. Have a bite and walk over to PNC Park for a ballgame - it's minutes away. Great place!\",\n",
       " u\"I freaking love this place! Really nice atmosphere (like you are at your old German Grandmother's house). I always go for the Weiner platter with three different kinds of Wursts. Potato Pancakes are a must. Chunky Apple sauce is great. Best German food in Pittsburgh!!!\",\n",
       " u\"I was at Max's last weekend. I'm from Chicago, so I was looking forward to trying a German pub in the Deutschtown neighborhood. Our friend took us here, and I really enjoyed it!  \\n\\nThe service was great and very friendly. The beer selection was awesome, and all the food was delicious! The menu is huge! We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer and the sausage and cheese plate, and both were very tasty! The mustard dipping sauce is phenomenal! I couldn't get enough of it. I wish I had left room for dessert because everything sounded spectacular. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself, which I heard used to be an old hotel, was quaint and cozy. I enjoyed the historical elements of the place; all very authentic and special. \\n\\nI will definitely recommend this pub to anyone traveling to Pittsburg!\",\n",
       " u\"A good selection of classic Pittsburgh beers and tasty German cuisine. The service is pretty good and it's a great place to watch a Pirates game.\",\n",
       " u\"Max's is my parents' favorite restaurant when they're in town visiting me. Good, solid food with a great deal of [German] variety. I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.\\n\\nThe food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there.\",\n",
       " u\"It's been over 5 years since I had been to Max's but we were in the area at lunch time so we decided to stop in. The menu is big and printed on a newspaper. They have all kinds of German food.  I decided to order a Reuben with a side of homemade chips. The sandwich came on rye bread that was toasted. It had lots of sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and sauce with the meat piled high. It is one of the best Reubens I have ever had. The chips were thinly sliced and very crispy. There was no need for a dipping sauce, the chips were very good just plain. They had 3 or 4 desserts that looked good but I chose the German Chocolate cake. It's one of my very favorite desserts. There were 3 layers of chocolate cake. In between the layers of cake there is coconut, chocolate, and pecans. The outside of the cake is frosted with a chocolate whipped frosting. It was really good. I need to go back to try the veal.\",\n",
       " u\"Frequent visitor. The place is definitely starting to slip food wise. Had a turkey rueben that had about 1 slice of turkey on it and not much else.fries are always soggy these days. I'll stick with the happy hour with half price apps. Daughter had the schnitzel which she said was very greasy which shouldn't be the norm. My water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it. Server was good though . Thank God for the staff .\",\n",
       " u'Came here with a large group of friends for dinner. They were great about the reservation we made for 12 and had a nice table in its own little room waiting for us when we arrived. I had the Hefeweizen style beer, which was good but had a strange taste and aftertaste to it, but it wasn\\'t so bad as I ordered a second one. For apps we had the  Bavarian nachos (not great by any means and actually very odd...and cold), the stuffed fried pretzel and the red cabbage with sausages. The red cabbage here is amazing, and the pretzel was fairly good with a honey mustard dipping sauce...but I guess its kind of hard to mess up something thrown into a deep fryer and stuffed with cheese. For our entrees I had their \"famous\" potato pancake Reuben with sides of red cabbage (couldn\\'t get enough!) and their house German potato salad - also very tasty. Fiance had potato pancakes, spatzel with cheese sauce and sausages. The spatzel was not in as a creamy a cheese sauce as I would have hoped - it was a bit oliy, not so much creamy. We were both a little underwhelmed sans the cabbage with the entire meal. I hate to say it - but I have had better authentic German style food at church potlucks and even Hofbrahaus (in a comparison to the beers at Hofbrahaus - these did just not stack up for me). I would give MAT another go round to try some of their other offerings - their schnitzels looked pretty good!',\n",
       " u\"Cozy down to earth atmosphere, cute to see familes of three generations sitting together for a Friday night meal. The food itself was ok but just a tad bit pricey. I thought my bavarian-style pretzels were a bit too heavy since they were deep-fried, and my friend's schnitzel platter with spatzle was a bit low on salt. Not a bad experience overall, but I might still rather go to Penn Brewery or Hofbrau next time.\",\n",
       " u'Not a fan of this \"german\" place. Simply awful. \\nWe ordered the Potato Pancake Reuben and a Traditional Reuben. So much gristle in the meat. Very low quality food for the price. \\nThe bar is cool, have stopped here in the past and enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar. \\nBar yes.\\nFood/Restaurant no.',\n",
       " u'Best place in town. I love the sampler platter and Sunday brunch is the best deal in town',\n",
       " u'Authentic German fare. German beer. Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Very fair portion sizes. You\\'ll be taking a box home. The basement is nice. But sometimes used for private events. Has a very cozy \"grotto\" feel to it.',\n",
       " u\"I love Max's but the food can be hit or miss sometimes. The staples on their menu are always good and time tested favorites but beware that special menu. There have been some epic duds on there that I wish I would have missed\",\n",
       " u\"It's hard to find a GOOD Chinese place. This is a GOOD Chinese place! The prices are awesome and the food is spectacular! The crab rangoon are under $5 and will leave you completely full! This place is great for satisfying that late night Chinese food craving!\",\n",
       " u\"Although I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, I'll admit that China Taste is serving up some very yummy Chinese food on the North Side. Although the storefront is a bit drab, don't let that deter you from stopping in and picking up some food. On a recent rainy Saturday afternoon, my boyfriend and I made our way over to grab some food. We placed our order., paid and returned about 10 minutes later to pick up the grub.\\n\\nI was in the mood for wonton soup and wasn't disappointed. Delicious, hot broth with a plentiful amount of wontons was promptly devoured. My boyfriend ordered two different beef and vegetable entrees, which were accompanied by white rice. I tasted some of his meal and agreed with him that it was very, very tasty.\\n\\nChina Taste was so good that we ended up stopping back later in the evening after we hit up the casino. I again ordered the wonton soup (although this time a whole quart). He ordered a quart of the chicken and broccoli. Again, super yummy.\\n\\nYep - the place is a whole in the wall, but the employees (the same were there both times) seemed pleasant. Plus, you cannot beat the price for what you get. It's redic cheap.\\n\\nStop in the next time you're in or near the North Side area.\",\n",
       " u\"I think the food was really, really, really good for the price. The appetizer we got, boiled dumplings, were especially yummy. The General Tso's chicken wasn't the best I've ever had but certainly wasn't bad at all. The egg roll was really good too. My mom picked up the food and she said it was kind of divey inside but that doesn't really matter to me. The food was great and it was quick, and cheap.\",\n",
       " u\"Followed the advice of my fellow yelpers, gave this place a shot, and I was not disappointed. My fianc\\xe9 and I moved to the area a little less then two years ago and up until now, we have been unsuccessful in finding our neighborhood go-to spot when it comes to Chinese. This is it! It's inexpensive and tasty. Its not overly salty like some Chinese take out tends to be.\",\n",
       " u\"Terrible service. I will NOT be visiting this place again. The owner gave me a serious attitude when I asked to pay for my order of 5 sandwiches in 2 different payment methods. There were a few people at my work that asked them to pick up lunch for them as well. He told me that doesn't split orders. I advised him I have been coming there for years and have always taken orders for my coworkers and giving him more business. I find it very hard to believe this is the first time someone has stopped in and asked to split an order up. The cleanliness of the deli has also gone downhill. I ordered ahead and still waiting 15 minutes past the time quoted for pick up. The owner grossly mishandled the situation I was polite and patient so to receive that response I was completely taken aback.\",\n",
       " u'What a great price $6.85 for a 12 inch hoagie!! No shortage of beef on this sandwich!   Here in the burg you can get Steak hoagies just about anywhere.   This is one of my favorite staple hoagies..  This may not have been the \"best\" but it was up there - nice solid sandwich.  The bread was fresh too.    Thank you North Shore Deli !!',\n",
       " u'Lovely and beautiful and very very clean. \\nWe had a wonderful stay the night before the marathon. \\nLocation is very central.',\n",
       " u\"Inside the old St. Mary's Priory, a beautiful hotel transformed from a real monastery is Monk's Bar. The tiny and I mean very small bar, with three tiny tables and three bar stools is big on properly made drinks. \\n\\nI sat at a stool which isn't high enough for the bar which made for a rather uncomfortable seating. My friend Katrina has known the lone bartender, Nikki for years and has been wanting to get me out of my comfort zone and try new places. I beat Katrina to the Priory and found a lot of free parking out front (after 7 pm street parking is free) and went inside. \\n\\nNow situated, I sat down and looked over the menu and decided on a Monktini, citron absolute, fresh lime juice and razzmatazz. Perfect for a warm summer night, not heavy or filling, a little sweet, a little tart. Refreshing! After Katrina arrived another couple walked in and sat at one of the small cafe tables, the tiny room induces conversation with others, especially when the bartender introduces you to everyone. \\n\\nTime for a bite and this is where Monk's Bar lost a star (the uncomfortably high bar and low stools cost them a star as well) but as a practicing vegan, there were no options I could enjoy. Sandwiches are served on pretzel buns (monks invented pretzels) with options like a ham and turkey club, turkey, creamy chicken salad, and a few others I forgot. I did order hummus but it wasn't filling at all. I did enjoy the house made Lemoncello, although I have made this in the past, Monk's makes there's with grain alcohol which I found to be too strong. I'll continue to make mine with 100 proof vodka and forgo the impending hiccups. \\n\\nIt was a very interesting night, made new friends, found an interesting new spot and a really cool building I'd love to explore more of. Everyone should try Monk's bar and get out of your comfort zone.\",\n",
       " u\"I had heard about The Priory from friends, especially the wine tastings.  I finally had the opportunity to attend in May 2015.\\n\\nI was very impressed with the entire event and the people.  The wine tasting was held in the courtyard which was nicely set up and the weather was beautiful.  The italian wine selection was delicious as was the food paired with the wine. There was an explanation of the wines and music that was a great addition. The staff and owners were friendly and helpful.  \\n\\nThere were imported cheeses beforehand that could be sampled even after the wine tasting had begun. \\n\\nThey even make homemade limoncello at the small and cozy bar after the tasting had ended (not included but that's ok).   It was very tasty. \\n\\nI will be back for sure.\",\n",
       " u\"Attended a wedding here and was blown away by its beauty and service. I would consider having a wedding reception here. The steak was one of the best reception dishes I've ever had.\",\n",
       " u\"An excellent business model includes extraordinary customer service. \\nMy brother who has good taste (except in women) booked the Priory Hotel as a safe haven for family members not in town for a celebration. Alone the first day, I ended up in conversations with two smart fellows: Adam, bartending at the jewel box Monk's Bar and Max, master of the front desk. At their suggestion, I took myself for a walk realizing, crossing the 9th St. Sister's Bridge, 'downtown' was closer than my local Whole Foods. So is the new stadium! It was beautiful later that Saturday evening, light rain drops on my face, looking up at the suspension bridge as I crossed the river again on to safe, well-marked sidewalks, having spontaneously bought an available ticket to an A+ traveling Broadway musical in the breathtaking Benedum Theater. (That's Pittsburgh!)\\nI opened the front door to my fully stocked, 2-storey, 2BR, 3BA, private townhouse to find 6 red roses on the dining table and a note - a gift from those fellows who witnessed my grief and hoping to cheer me, left a coupon for a glass of wine and a reminder to return under happier circumstances. How 'bout That.  Plus, the linens are cotton, the mattress was superior, the parking is free, the coffee, made in the right proportion was delicious and the continental breakfast served fresh fruit, local bagels, and real butter! It was as much a home away from home as you can get. On the way to PIT, we stopped and lined up the roses for Mom. Thank you, gentlemen, thank you Priory (thanks, bro).\",\n",

       " u'Got tickets to the ZoSo concert at Stage AE and decided to switch up my pre-lube location from something other than the Tilted Kilt, River Towne or Bettis Grill. I decided on the Clark Bar.  \\n\\nI\\'ve only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago. I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: \"Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for #lunch. Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N. Shore of #pgh\" (the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here). So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show. \\n\\nSpeaking of beers, there\\'s a limited selection of craft beers here.  As of this writing, on tap they\\'ve got Penn Marzen, Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap.  In bottles there\\'s Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t think so).\\n\\nI walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasn\\'t too crowded; possibly due to the weather.  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like I\\'ve experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lot.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my date to join me, I started with a Sam Adam\\'s Cold Snap as a tribute to the day\\'s February, single digit, temps before moving on to the Marzen. Both were decent beers, very drinkable, but nothing all that special.\\n\\nIt was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner. By that time we were the only people left in the bar.  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night.  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks. Other than those times, it\\'s before and after the ball games that draws the most business (as you would expect).\\n\\nThe menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and the \"House Specialty\" Fish and Chips.  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials, wings and a Cajun burger.  I decided I would go Cajun tonight. My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger. \\n\\nMy Cajun burger was spicy good delicious; perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce. I also got a sample slice of my lady\\'s turkey burger (yeah, we do that) and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato. Her burger came with slaw and mine with fries.\\n\\nOverall this is a casual, easy bar.  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan.  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner. But what\\'s really cool is all of the autographed baseballs, bats and footballs in the hallway behind the bar.\\n\\nI\\'d recommend this place to any out-of-towner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore. I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service and delicious burgers. If the beer selection was better I would have up it to five stars.',\n",
       " u\"Horrible food, horrible service. I'm really not sure how this place manages to stay in business.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is fantastic, some of the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. The owner is always very nice and the ingredients are always fresh. My only complaint is that I probably gained a pound or two eating here too often. 5/5 would recommend.\",\n",

       " u\"I hate to post anything negative,  but seriously, this place was one of the worst.  We weren't expecting top of the line anything,.but everything about this place was bad.  The place was pretty dirty, the coffee was like water, we waited close to an hour for our food (apparently the cook decided to leave for about 45 minutes), the waitress-owner was more interested in drinking beers with another set of customers (at 9:30 in the morning!!) than checking on us.  The food was beyond bad-oh'...and ice cold.  The waitress, the one time she came over, literally spilled.a good amount of coffee on our table and just walked back to her drinking buddies.  It was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar.\",\n",

       " u\"I've been here for breakfast a number of times and always enjoy it.  It's typical diner-style breakfast food, comparable to Pamela's or DeLuca's but without the crowds and long lines.

I would definitely recommend it, I know I'll be back again.\",\n",
       " u'Vietnamese people LOVE french baguettes. It has something to do with French occupation resulting in my older relatives knowing how to speak French and eating my curry with bread. (Grammar-wise, why are all my relatives eating my curry? I refuse to fix the previous sentence.)\\n\\nI went on a journey through Pittsburgh in search of a good baguette. Of course, being a student, my first destinations were Giant Eagle, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. After I finished sobbing with swollen gums, curled up at the bottom of my bathtub, I was determined to not give up. Then I found the outdoor bread stand at Strip District, Allegro, and BreadWorks Bakery. All three make fantastic bread and specialize in their own things, but the award for best baguette goes to BreadWorks Bakery. For now... DUN DUN DUN.\\n\\nSo of course, with every bakery, there is the option of buying and eating right away. But there is also the option for half-baked baguettes at BreadWorks, where the bread is not fully finished and you finish the rest of the baking yourself. Now, if you hear yourself saying, \"Why would I do the rest of the job for them?\" I don\\'t want to be your friend. Who would not want freshly baked bread at home? Ugh, who are you? Anyways, I buy a bag of those, put it in my freezer, then finish it off in the oven whenever I need my baguette fix. (Seriously, I love this bread. My girlfriend is worried about my waistline).\\n\\nSo what makes a good baguette? It has to be crunchy and thin on the outside, but delicate, light, and soft on the inside. You don\\'t fight the bread when you eat it (and it shouldn\\'t win, for that matter... your poor gums after sub-par bread); instead, it should break and tear easily. The bread here has those qualities.\\n\\nThe rest of the breads are good. There are tons of varieties. The mini rolls are adorable. And I LOVE BREAD.\\n\\nBesides the delicious bread, this stuff is also cheap, so huge bonus of awesomeness right there.',\n",
       " u\"Incredible bread here!  They don't use preservatives so you better make sure you eat it up fast or have room in the freezer. They have a large selection of breads. The daily rotation of Focaccia is something worth checking out. I think Monday is pepperoni focaccia day\",\n",
       " u\"How have I not reviewed Breadworks yet?!  Shame on me. \\n\\nI love coming here for fresh bread--the only down side is that I feed two people, and most of the loaves that they sell are for at least four people, so I end up eating at least two servings of bread with dinner.  Can't fault them for that, though...\\n\\nThey have french loaves, breadsticks, specialty focaccias...and I am just addicted to their  salt sticks.  SO GOOD!\\n\\nThey are cash only, but you don't need much, because I have never spent more than $5 here.  (Yes, you read that correctly.  The bread is AMAZING and at least half off from what you'd pay in the strip for the same loaf.) \\n\\nIf you're anywhere close, make sure you try it!\",\n",
       " u'Bread works is really good and you can get really good rooks you should go there it is in Pittsburgh PA',\n",
       " u'Going to the store is highly addictive. And bring a kid with you, they will give them bread! Great place.',\n",
       " u\"Why have I not been getting bread from BreadWorks my entire life?  I have never actually been inside BreadWorks, but tons of Pittsburgh restaurants use their bread.  So finally, my parents stopped in with a 50% off coupon last weekend to try some different things.  And since I am poor thanks to graduate school, they shared.\\n\\nFirst, we tried an assortment of rolls. If you are a fan on Max's Allegheny Tavern, this is where they order their rolls from!  My personal favorite was the pumpernickel raisin roll.  \\n\\nHowever, the real winner of this trip was the pepperoni and cheese focaccia style bread they picked up. It was served in a pizza box, and probably about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. This bread was amazing. It was packed with pepperoni and amazing cheese.  Then, there was baked cheese all over the top layer of the bread.  It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. I savored every last bite.\\n\\nMy parents walked out with all of this for under $4 so it would normally be around $8.  What a steal!  I just wish BreadWorks was a bit more convenient to my house, but it is so good that I am willing to travel!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm still a fan but something is starting to change here and not for the better. The last two times I've bought from here I've been a little disappointed. I got some hoagy rolls that were dense and tasted flat, I've had better from Sam's club. Today I stopped and asked for some Rustic Italian and what I got was a regular Italian loaf and it was only so-so. It was only slightly better than any other place that bakes it's own Italian like Shop n save. Maybe the store clerk gave me the wrong bread and I hope so because I have loved this place for years and I hope they aren't just making for the restaurant trade now.\",\n",
       " u'I ordered lunch from Ron\\'s Pizza Palace after a staff member of theirs visited my work\\'s building to promote Ron\\'s to nearby businesses. The staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day, so my coworkers and I figured we\\'d give them a try. And...I was pretty underwhelmed. \\n\\nFor starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I\\'d gotten that info when I ordered. But what in the world did he plan on doing if I hadn\\'t calculated my payment in advance? Would I have had to call in to sort out their staff\\'s mistake? Would I have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off? I have no idea.\\n\\nAnd the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired. I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn\\'t rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. \\n\\nAs for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn\\'t even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich\\'s bread shouldn\\'t break off when I bite into it, but that\\'s what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.\\n\\nI currently don\\'t plan on ordering from this place again. This is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for\" - and personally I\\'d prefer to spend a couple extra dollars for a tastier and more satisfying lunch.',\n",
       " u\"We ate here often when there were on East Ohio before the road restructure. We have adopted a new life style and try to eat healthier and though they offer salads, I am too tempted by the unhealthy selections.

I've never been there for lunch, but if it's anything like breakfast, then you are in good hands. The baristas are quirky yinzers who are genuinely entertaining, even in the wee early morning.

First- Cool Beans brews Nicholas Coffee & Tea Company, a well respected & deeply rooted company in the Pittsburgh community. They have rotating flavors and an excellent selection of specialty coffee drinks. They have a wide variety of flavored syrups and a few sugar free flavors. I haven\\'t personally tried the food they offer but during a recent conversation with a barista, I found out that most of the food is homemade! The menu is also rotating with fresh offerings such as: pepperoni rolls, meatball subs, pulled pork sandwiches, tortilla soup, cookies & muffins. The prices for food & drink are very reasonable! Trust me :) \\n\\nTo pair nicely with the food & drink choices, the staff is incredibly personable! Even though I don\\'t stop down often, one of the main baristas remembers my exact order! Now that\\'s great service and quite the memory! \\n\\nSo, my yelping friends, next time you need your morning cup-o-joe or a mid-day pick me up, skip the Starbucks line & head over to Cool beans!',\n",
       " u\"The worst customer service ever!!!!!!! When I told my stylist which design I wanted, she proceeded to say that the stat wouldn't look right on a shorter nail. she then offered to do a Freestyle  design on my nails which was horrible I did not like it at all. I told her then that I change my mind that did not want to design and she got a attitude when I asked for my money back for the design. She couldn't talk to other customers about the predicament comparing our situation to one at the restaurant. I will never ever come back to this establishment because not only do they do poor work they are rude and disrespectful.\",\n",
       " u'I tried the calzone tonight.  It was fantastic!  Italian sausage with peppers and onions.  What I liked most was that it was cooked perfectly.  Done the whole way through, but not overdone.  Glad I went.',\n",
       " u'I ordered fried chicken for my work holiday luncheon and it was delicious!!!! It was seasoned perfectly. I will definitely order from there again.',\n",
       " u'This is a great place for small and large groups.  Great drink selection, the draft beer selection was pretty weak but the have a decent selection of beer in a bottle.  \\n\\nThe food is very good.  I had the smokehouse platter.  The ribs were very good. The platter also comes with smothered chicken   It was awesome.  I felt the chicken was the highlight of the plate.  Hand cut fries were good also.  I give this a big thumbs up.',\n",
       " u\"This is more of a 3.5 star rating. I visited this restaurant with a large group of about 40 people before going to a show at the New Hazlett Theater. We were seated upstairs and ate a buffet-style dinner (the dishes had already been picked). The two waiters who took care of us were extremely friendly and efficient, and they made sure we would leave in time for our show. While we waited for the food to come out, they served us drinks, but the waiter stopped offering straws after the first couple tables.\\n\\nWhen the food came out, they let a few tables help themselves at a time. They provided us with three different types of plates (large square ones, rectangular ones, and small circular ones), which I found odd. We had three entrees in the buffet line: Chicken Marsala, Tomato Vodka pasta, and Parmesan Crusted Tilapia.\\n\\nChicken Marsala: flavorful, tender chicken served with mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the potatoes because they had a distinct potato flavor, unlike most butter-heavy ones. However, I wish they were more generous with the tomatoes and mushrooms in the dish. There was no vegetable-based dish in our entire meal, and I missed them.\\n\\nTomato Vodka pasta: penne cooked with just a little bite left in a yummy tomato sauce with a couple leaves of spinach here and there. Again, I wished there was a lot more spinach in the dish. Also, the pasta was a little sauce-heavy.\\n\\nParmesan Crusted Tilapia: the fish was crispy and delicious, the angelhair pasta was cooked perfectly, and the tomato sauce was good. I grabbed some pasta near the edge that hadn't been touched by sauce, so I liked the amount. No vegetables, though.\\n\\nAfterwards, they brought out a tray of bite-size desserts for us. I don't see any of them on their menu, so I'm not sure how the organization ordered them. Both the cheesecake flavors I tried (raspberry and almond) were delicious--the cheesecake was really light and airy, and the flavors really came through without being overly sweet or overpowering. They also had strawberry halves and chocolate chip cookies, which were soft and cakey--not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Also, there were these little squares that, as far as I could tell, were squares of iced cake covered in chocolate. These were way too sweet for my taste. Mine looked like chocolate everything, but there were also white-chocolate covered squares, and other squares with different colors inside (different flavors of icing, perhaps?).\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, but I'd like to try a greater variety before giving four full stars (and see if there are any vegetable-heavy ones). However, this restaurant is a little too expensive for me to return any time soon. The service was great.\",\n",
       " u'Thank you James and staff for the wonderful entrees and for giving us one more reason to like Pittsburgh.',\n",
       " u'Before a Pirates game we stopped in to get a bite. I ordered a hamburger with fries for $13.00. Very disappointed. It took over 30 minutes to get the order. The meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked. This tells me that they added \"filler\", usually bread, to stretch the meat and pump profits. I\\'ve had juicier meat and larger patty at Wendy\\'s for a sixth of the price. Overall...I would not go back to Atria\\'s.',\n",
       " u'Nothing special here. I went with a group. The beef was a little salty, and the breaded chicken parmesean was equally as unimpressive. The breading was soggy and lacked any crispiness. And the dessert was obviously catered from elsewhere, like a local supermarket dessert tray.',\n",
       " u'Fantastic food and atmosphere, and right in the heart of Pittsburgh right at the foot of the baseball stadium. Will definitely hit up the next time in Pittsburgh!',\n",
       " u'The drinks agree to die for and the pot roast nachos were amazing. The waiter Jonathan not only catered to us but actually drew is a map of places to see. Definitely a place to come back to.',\n",
       " u'Although my meat was dry, the food overall was delicious: my chicken breast smothered in mushrooms and onions with cheddar jack cheese, the homemade chips, and my wife\\'s \"Pittsburgher\" kielbassi slices with pierogies, sour cream, sauerkraut, and mustard.  We were not brought or offered bread.  What brought down this rating was service problems which obviously were not the fault of our server.  I appreciated that the restaurant offered me a reservation when Open Table indicated that nothing was available on this day. The hostess did not seem to know how to handle a reservation and I do not believe that our arrival was matched to it. She asked another individual for assistance and I believe that person told her simply to seat us. After more than ten minutes had passed after we were seated without a server coming to the table, the hostess came over to ask if she could take a drink order.  She was not able to answer my question about whether the featured beers were draft or bottled.  Soon thereafter, our server, a charming and gracious young man, came to take the drink order.  We asked him to take our dinner order as well, given that this was stacking up to be a very lengthy meal.  More than fifteen minutes later, our entrees came, but no sign of my wife\\'s wine and my beer.  I asked the young man who brought the food about our drinks and a few minutes later, our server came over, apologized, and told us how backed up the bar was.  He graciously told us that the drinks would be complimentary.  We received them more than five minutes after the arrival of our entrees.  These were not mixed drinks requiring anything special to dispense, simply beverages that had to be poured.  For almost the entire time we were there, a band was playing inside at a volume that was deafening.  We could not possibly have had our meal inside near the band as it would have been necessary to use sign language to converse and to order. We were seated outside as far away from the music as possible, yet it was still difficult to speak to each other over the din.  Additionally, the placement of the band in a small room makes it particularly difficult to snake in and out when coming in to use the restroom. The menu at this Atria\\'s is a bit different from the traditional locations and some of the prices are not the same for items that are identical.  The homemade chips are $2.99 at traditional Atria\\'s locations, $3.99 at PNC Park for a smaller portion.',\n",
       " u'Just went to this restaurant to try and have dinner and the guy that sat us was very nice but after waiting 10 minutes with no sign of a server my husband finally asked if they could send someone to wait on us and they said they would. Waited another 5 minutes and no one showed up so we got up and left. Awful place, to bad I was looking forward. We only wish we would have ordered food and then left.',\n",
       " u\"I really wanted to like this place, but everything about it was extremely disorganized. Only one bartender was able to get anything accomplished (and thankfully he was the one serving me). The rest of the staff seemed to have no direction, and the aforementioned bartender was the one picking up their slack. Try as he could, he could not do it all. And this was only 4 hours before game time; it was bound to get busier as the day moved on.\\n\\nThat said, the food was good (Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich) and there is an extensive beer selection. I will certainly give Atria's another shot when I return to the Burgh.\",\n",
       " u\"I have enjoyed dining at Atria's over the years.  I used to love their Pot Roast Nachos, but a few years ago they changed the recipe (the pot roast is nowhere near as generous as it used to be).  But I would say the food is reliably good, and the service is generally excellent (except when they are overwhelmed on game days).  \\n\\nI do have a great story about meeting Hulk Hogan at this location once, so I do have a special fondness for Atria's.  They are well managed and local.  \\n\\nBut the dining scene in Pittsburgh has become a lot more creative, I think Atria's needs to keep up and offer something new and different.  Until then, it's still pretty good and fairly reliable.\",\n",
       " u\"This is not a review about the food or service at Atria's, which I have always found more than satisfactory, but rather about their handling of our reservation.  I had wanted to dine at Atria's for their Oktoberfest menu, and with Saturday night being the last of October, I made reservations for a friend and I at the PNC Park location.  Just to be sure, I called the restaurant and asked if the location was featuring the Oktoberfest menu.  The girl who answered assured me that they were. \\n\\nWhen we checked in, I again asked if they were doing the Oktoberfest menu, and again was assured they were although they did not give me the special menu which was sitting next to the regular menu at the host's podium.\\n\\nI didn't see any of the Oktoberfest specials listed on the menu, so I asked our server, a pleasant young man named Qwan about it.  He told me that the O specials were listed in a box on the lower left hand corner of the menu.  When I questioned the skimpy selection given there, he told me that they were not featuring the entire Oktoberfest menu on weekends at that location, but only a selection of appetizers and small plates.  He told me that all other locations were featuring the whole menu.   He seemed surprised and disinclined to believe me when I told him that that was not satisfactory, especially in light of the fact I had called to check and had been told that the special menu was being offered, and that we would be leaving. I got on Open Table and secured a reservation for dinner at their Wexford location, a half-hour's drive out of town. I didn't speak to anyone from the restaurant's management because we had to leave to make our reservation time at the Wexford location.\\n\\nIt is certainly any restaurant's right to serve whatever menu or part of a menu they wish, but they should also inform people when they call if they are not honoring the complete published special menu advertised.  \\n\\nThe food and service at the Wexford location were acceptable other than a spinach salad that arrived only after I had asked about it and without the warm sweet and sour dressing advertised on the menu.  They had also run out of the apple strudel that was on the menu, but that's always a chance you take on a popular menu item.\",\n",
       " u'We arrived at 6pm on a busy Sat nite. A party of 6, we agreed to sit 2 and 4. We were at bar for a bit while waiting and bar tender was friendly and made us feel welcome. When our tables were ready, we were not given menus for about 20 minutes when we flagged down a bartender who brought them over and took our orders. Food took at least 20 more minutes to arrive. Salmon was great but not much rice and would have been better with a veggie side to round it out. Food overall was fine. They ended up comping some of our drinks.',\n",

Reasonable prices for eating out and quality choices. I'm glad there are more than chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese! \\n\\nAnd we love the photo booth in the cafe that prints 2 photo strips!\",\n",
       " u'This museum is amazing! As a parent, I thought everything was so fun, even for me! We took our one year old and I was worried that there would not be much for him to do. But I was wrong.

       " u\"Something about the sauce makes me like their pizza.  I think it has a sweet taste to it.  They'll make special requests if you ask them.  Customers and accompanying foot traffic outside is a bit rough in this area of the northside lol.  I like the old school crane arcade machine near the counter.  Dining area is a bit small.  Sometimes doesn't seem like the cleanest joint around, but works for me!\",\n",
       " u\"It's a little rough around the edges, but the food is great, and you can't beat the prices! Sometimes there is only one cook in the kitchen, so service can be a bit slow, but everything I've had has been worth the wait. I've tried the (Pittsburgh) chicken salad, gryo, and white, cheese, and pepperoni pizza. All have been delicious. There is some  seating, but there are often locals hanging around, so if that's not your scene, just pick up to go or request delivery.\",\n",
       " u\"I stopped by yesterday at around 5:30 with CM to grab some dinner after spending the afternoon at the Aviary.  I'd wanted to try Wilson's last weekend before a visit to the Mattress Factory, but wasn't able to because we lacked cash, and Wilson's is a cash only establishment.  This time, we came prepared with plenty of green, so we were able to get our BBQ bliss on.\\n\\nIn case you don't notice the heady odor of smoked meat when approaching Wilson's, it literally hits you in the face as soon as you walk in.  I first inquired about the chicken, but was told by the gentleman working behind the counter (presumably Mr. Wilson) that they were out of it for the day.  Thus, CM and I decided to split a large plate of ribs (around $12), which comes with 6 bones.  Because we'd heard that Wilson's hot sauce is seriously hot, we ordered a mix of hot and mild sauce for the ribs.  For sides, we decided to order the collard greens and the potato salad ($1.34 each), and I got a can of iced tea, as well ($1).  Because he's still having some trouble breathing from his ongoing cold, CM requested that we get our items to go, so I obliged.\\n\\nAfter finding a picnic table in West Park commons with a little help from a local resident, we unpacked the food and dug in.  We first tried the ribs, and found them appropriately smoky and the right texture, with sufficient give but not falling apart.  The sauce was just the right level of spiciness to satisfy both of us, as well--spicy enough to provide a nice kick, but not so spicy as to be overwhelming.  After finishing the ribs, we both used the slices of white bread provided to soak up the remaining sauce.  As for the sides, they were clearly homemade and of good quality and flavor, though the potato salad was a bit mushier than I'm accustomed to, and the collards were a bit saltier than I'd like.\\n\\nOverall, we were quite pleased with the quality and amount of food that we received for the price that we paid (around $16).  Make no mistake: Wilson's is a hole in the wall, but in the best sense of the phrase--check it out for solid, unpretentious BBQ that hits the spot for a casual picnic lunch or dinner if you happen to be in the area.\",\n",
       " u'Simply the best ribs you can find in Pittsburgh. Also make sure to get an order of greens with your take out order',\n",

       " u\"I almost turned around and left after going in here this afternoon, but I was too hungry to walk away from the amazing smell that surrounds this place for about three blocks. Ok so glad I didn't let the total lack of ambiance or AC turn me off! The people are great and the BBQ and macaroni salad are the best I've ever had. I didn't even know I could eat a half a chicken, but I sure did today! If if been alone, I'm pretty sure I'd have licked the plate, too. This place is amazing. Make sure you have cash on hand!\",\n",
       " u\"I have grown up on Wilson's ribs and chicken and have always loved it. Today I stopped by and was not disappointed. The hot sauce is exactly how I've remembered it. The ribs fell off the bone. The potato salad is amazing, and I tried the greens for the 1st time and it was just as good. It may sound like I'm over hyping Wilsons but, it follows through with how great it is. The service was also extremely friendly too. I can't wait to go back :-) best bbq in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"Don't risk it. Never open when you need it, unreliable availability with his products. He offered to reserve some for me until it was done cooking and then when I returned on time he had already sold it.

This is seriously one of the last remaining Isaly's locations so it really should draw more attention than it does.

But since we started buying Wiseguys pizza, we have been very happy with the pies we get. Sometimes Dar picks em up, and sometimes they deliver, And we're not easy to find. We live in the woods. But either way the pizza is always great. We love their crust, and it all tastes good the next day or 2.  They are very polite on the phone and in person.  We tell our friends and family all the time how much we love Wiseguys Pizza . We have had them over to taste it too and they agree they are good at pizza.   Most important they aren't over priced.

Their steak sandwich was bland and overcooked, but the veggies they added on were cooked well. They have several other sandwiches that are covered in obnoxious amounts of toppings, probably just to confuse your palate to thinking that you're eating something good. I must say though, their bread is really good. And this is coming from a South Philly girl. \\n\\nTheir wings are hit or miss. The first few times I've ordered them, they were big and cooked well.

I decided to give it another shot the other night and I really regret it.  I ordered the fried fish sandwich and even though it was crisp on the outside to the point of being somewhat burnt yet the inside was cold and the fish just had a weird texture like maybe it was freezer burnt or really old.  The place is dingy and poorly lite, it looks dirty and the overall experience was just downright unpleasant.  No, just no.  That is all.',\n",
       " u\"I live in Mckees Rocks the home of pizza joints and this is the only place we order from now. They deliver to my house and its always fast. I have waited for Doughboys and Mama Lenas for well over an hour and I'm not far from either. They have the most delicious Garlic Wings...they have a sauce to die for and they are nice and juicy. They have very good pizza with good sauce and lots of cheese. All their sides are good and everything they have is reasonably priced I don't have to pay $8 for French fries or Onion Rings like some places charge(if they read these they know who I'm talking about) Try Chubby's out you won't be sorry.\",\n",
       " u'I really loved the food and some of the employees. But WOW did that manager make a mistake speaking to me the way he did over a 1.5 hour delivered pizza ( I live 7 blocks) with unmelted cheese and wings with no sauce. \" heat up your pizza and I\\'ll bring some sauce down in an hour \" not the response a customer ever wants to hear. It\\'s a shame. All it would have take n was a new pizza and wings. $20 a week plus gone from them.',\n",
       " u\"The food they have is very good. It's like a warm welcome when you come in the door. The customer service is a plus. It's a place to try.\",\n",
       " u'Comfortable rooms, quiet setting, friendly host, tasty breakfasts, and great rates!  Just minutes from the city, but feels like the country.  We love The Arbors for a sweet getaway.',\n",
       " u'We stayed 2 nights and really enjoyed it. Even though it is in the city, once you get there, it is secluded and quiet. Our room was very big and had everything we needed, including Wi-fi. Jim, the manager/host, was very friendly and helpful with directions and sightseeing recommendations. Pursuant to local ordinance, they cannot do a hot breakfast, but there was plenty of food - cereals, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, and yummy baked goods. You get a key to the house and to your room, so you can come and go as you please. We would definitely stay here again.',\n",
       " u'The best bakery ever!!! Cake is the best ever, no other bakery as good!  Not bethel bakery...Oakmont bakery....my favorite',\n",
       " u\"Twas the night before Thanksgiving....\\nnot a ton of options left at 11:30am- we got a small assortment 3 filled cookies and 1/2 a dozen thumbprints and another random pastry....we walked up to the register & were told $3.65. whaaaa, I'm thinking to myself, is this right, it can't be because it is so ridiculously cheap!!! But it was- in my book 10 items for less than 4 items is a steal. Then I began to worry- usually cheap means not good quality or just not good. \\nWe just got home & I couldn't resist the cookies- I thought I'll just have 1/2 of the cherry filled cookie...but it was so good- tart jelly filling & nice buttery brown sugar cookie- just trust so yum- I had to eat the other half!\",\n",
